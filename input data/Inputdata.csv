3-Dimension Integrated Circuit (3D-IC)","Developing a unique competitive advantage simultaneously complying with future trends has emerged as a strategy for obtaining competitive advantage in the global marketplace. Technical service platform design can improve customer satisfaction by integrating diversified products and technologies. Prior studies have alluded to developing a framework of technical service platforms and validated methodologies. This finding motivated our research. Hence, we proposed a multi-step approach to organize technical service platforms based on corporate strength while incorporating technological capability during platform development. A case study referencing a company developing 3-Dimension Integrated Circuitry (3D-IC) for the semiconductor industry was presented to demonstrate its advantages. Six alternatives were evaluated to ensure the compliance of our research with market demands. The outcomes presented that the development priorities of this company could be platforms of logic IC, analog IC and memory IC because these platforms can be effectively developed from core competences. In addition, this company also had capability to provide services covering IC design, 3D stacking & assembly, and technical consulting to both upstream customers and downstream partners and this was one of developing strategy. According to our method, enterprises can address existed and potential customer requirements, develop more innovative services to meet different market segments and achieve economies of scale. Decision makers can determine feasible alternatives and scenario analysis can support decision makers to provide solutions for all future situations under uncertainties. Consequently, company strength can be extended and remain invincible in the future through integration of technical service platform design and technology forecasting."

Plastic recycling industry
Collaboration","In recent years, technology starts to make advance in new electronic products. But, large amounts of electronic waste have an impact on environment gradually which leads to many countries begin to emphasize on reuse of resources. On the other hand, Taiwan government also actively establishes environmental regulations to encourage consumers buying remanufactured goods and promote enterprises to build up the green design, green production and remanufacture.
In the traditional supply chain of renewable resources, it consists of the government, recyclers and manufacturers. In previous research, the government focuses on the payment of subsidies and administrative costs, recyclers are focused on the improvement of recovery rate and maximize the benefits, manufacturers pay an attention to the supply chain’s collaboration and its own profits as a key point. Some studies investigate the relationship between them. However, recycling and purchasing recycled products by consumers are also involved that directly affects manufactures’ will of buying secondary materials products and benefit of recyclers. Consumers receive recycling incentives for recycling, which directly affect the level of consumers’ recycling behavior. The spending of recycling incentives provides the source of waste materials, while causes a higher cost.
In this study, we consider that consumers in the supply chain and the competition of other manufacturers are included to explore the main manufacturers’ will to buy the secondary materials, as well as that the price recyclers are willing to provide to consumers of the recycled waste materials, then recyclers will decide selling the resources to main manufactures or to other manufacturers to reach better benefits. Furthermore, the government plays a role of supporting and coordination the manufacturer and recycler by subsidies. 
In order to find the optimal decision, this study constructs a bi-level programming (BLP) model. The hierarchical and interactive nature between the two parties can be formulated by BLP to investigate two different levels of decision-making problems. In this study, we set the manufacturer as the higher-level decision maker and the recyclers as the lower-level decision maker. Higher-level decision maker adjusts the price of secondary material to achieve maximum benefit. On the other hand, lower-level decision maker maximizes profits through changing the secondary materials sold volume and the price of recycling incentives. In addition, this research will use PP and PE plastic containers as numerical examples in the practice to illustrate how recyclers and re-manufacturers to implement of green production and resource recycling effectively.

New products have to survive in the price competition and replacement of other new products. Product Life Cycle (PLC) might early fall into maturity stage or decline stage if it lacked effective planning. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to significantly enhance the competitiveness of products and companies in new product development if the relevant product features, quality issues, production patterns and overall cost control could be early considered to figure out the best solution before market intorduction.
This research investigates how a company under limited resources and technology capability can develop new products with a ase study on SiP product development in wireless communications industry. We firstly identify main features or minor features of key components in SiP product by Value Engineer (VE). Then, we conduct an in-depth interview and adopt the advice of experts to evaluate the cost and quality issues of key components and give weights to all of key components with Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). Finally, we propose an optimum solution in SiP new product development and which could effectively streamline production processes, improve process stability and production yield to achieve a cost reduction of 5% to main features, 15% to minor features, 8.5% in packaging process, and 33% in testing process. This research would be applied to review new product to enhance the competitiveness and accurately grasp the benefit of new product before mass production. It could be a reference guideline for decision makers and designers as a decision support system.

Ratings of Perceived Exertion","Products, customers and service are intimately connected, even in the realm of video sports games. As the media reminds us, the lack of sufficient exercise has become a crucial health concern, even though most people know that regular moderate exercise can promote good physical conditions and help prevent disease. Therefore this research investigates Kinect Sports, an interactive technology tool for health management (product) that involves a simulated sports environment for its users (customers). Kinect’s goal is to help users achieve an effective exercise level that provides them with a high level of satisfaction (service). However, many Kinect users are unaware of whether or not they achieve an effective exercise level. Therefore, this study presents a logistic regression model to detect the effectiveness of exercise and to provide sport service recovery suggestions when effective exercise is not achieved. An empirical study demonstrates the proposed methodology. We collected and analyzed both objective physiological data (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure) and subjective psychological data (e.g., ratings of perceived exertion). Results show the effectiveness of our model which can help users determine the effectiveness of their individual exercise with Kinect, generating uniquely suited guidelines in accordance with different levels of exercise effectiveness."

Stckelberg game","Due to the public environmental awareness arising and legislative requirements, firms are forced to adopt sustainable supply chain management. Green supply chain management (GSCM) is emerged as a systematic solution for firms to maintain competiveness. Besides, service-providing is another strategy which is commonly adopt by manufacturers to improve their competitiveness. Numerous researches have investigated the effects of service and consumer environmental awareness on supply chains, while few studies have discussed the intersections between service and consumer environmental awareness. A supply chain consisting of two manufacturers and a retailer is considered in this thesis. Assume that the first manufacturer is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that produces new product, while the second manufacturer is the remanufacturer producing refurbished products. Both manufacturers sell products to a common retailer and provide service to their end consumers. Consumer demand is influenced by three factors: (1) retail price, (2) service and (3) the efforts of eco-friendly operations. Hence, we provide a Stackelberg game model which is used to represent the decision-making of manufacturers and the retailer. The objective is to find optimal pricing policies to maximize their profits of all members in this supply chain. We also derive the corresponding existence and uniqueness conditions for equilibrium solutions. Furthermore, we extend the proposed model and take the consumer stochastic demand as well as the costs of goods shortage and salvage value of unsold products into account. Finally, numerical examples are provided and demonstrate the results as follows: (1) manufacturers can improve their profit by increasing the service level or eco-friendly level; (2) manufacturers’ profit may not increase with the consumer green awareness; and (3) manufacturers should adopt different production strategies under different situation to maximize their own profit when facing demand uncertainty."

IDC (International Data Corporation) estimates that the amount of data will increase by 10 times from 2013 to 2020; precisely, the total amount may grow from 4.4 trillion gigabytes to 44 trillion gigabytes. The explosion causes the analysis and applications of Big Data to become an important research issue. If the Big Data can be appropriately used, it will bring new values and innovations for life as well as a new trend of information systems and services.
This paper attempts to incorporate the functions of information visualization and intelligent analysis of Big Data into the concept of service platforms. We build an integrated information service platform to provide diverse services for users, and promote the development of cloud service applications. This platform provides three kinds of main services: data filtering, data visualization and intelligent analysis, which help users represent the data in a faster and more effective way.
In addition, we demonstrate the usefulness of our platform by testing medical disease data as case studies. The result shows that our platform can effectively help users to retrieve valuable information from the vast experimental data. More specifically, to the visualization tool helps identify imported diseases and its location areas. Moreover, the intelligent analysis detects new test reagents and the antibiotic resistance genes for drug development. This prototype can thus offer data analysis service on Big Data via this user-friendly interface. Finally, we collaborated with Chang Gung Molecular Medicine Research Center by applying our function modules－automatic visualization and intelligence analysis tools to their Targeted Sequencing System. Therefore, our platform can successfully support the construction of other information service systems. In the future, we expect that the platform can provide an integrated service of data processing, data analysis, and data visualization on Big Data in other research fields."

The effect of Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is related to if it could save dying patients immediately and if it could increase the survival rate of patients given first aid afterward. It could discover unstable patients early and provide them medical care if we combine clinical alert system (CAS) and residents' working shifts; also, it could reduce IHCA event. Because most of the data in medical field is imbalanced data type; in addition, there is a better robustness for imbalanced data in MTS, this paper aims to analyze the data of patients in ordinary ward of case study hospital by MTS method in order to build up CAS for IHCA. After we selected the system features: diastolic blood pressure, Temperature, Pulse rate and Respiratory rate, we used the Mahalanobis-distance to be the alert standard of system. Moreover, three commonly used classification method: artificial neural network, decision tree and logistic regression, are implemented using the same data set. The result showed that there is a better classification rate in MTS for imbalanced data type."

Photolithography is the most complicated and key part in IC process flow, taking up about 40%~50% above all process. It is necessary to allocate mask, machine and wafer in the process flow appropriately. In order to reach efficiency and increase rate of equipment utilization, reducing cycle time(C/T) of wafer on each machine during photolithography is expected.
It's capable of install coater, exposure and developer in series on the same machine to shorten C/T. However, there are still many methods to keep cutting down C/T .Except for adding parallel machine, running the existing parallel machine efficiently is also required. In other words, it makes every machine reach the best in the loading and reduce C/T on the restrictions of mask by transferring goods. It does works, and wafers are produced on time as expected.
This research collected information of an IC manufactory in Science Park to set up a model of photolithography considering all the constraints on process. We found out a better wafer transfer dispatching solution through SSO algorithms and MM-SSO, and establishing a complete arithmetic logic applied to photolithography dispatching system. After testing and debugging, the logical operation can be applied to the follow-up study and demonstration in pratice. It's able to downsize and save time about 70% by algorithms automatic dispatching.

Therefore, how to integrate all the services and related information is getting more important. Many enterprises have regarded logistics as the core competence of their corporate strategy, improving the quality of logistic services and integrating the comprehensive services to enhance their competitive advantage. However, the current logistics industries have encountered some limitations and bottlenecks in the operational model of industries, such as transportation efficiency, information transparency and the lack of integration between material, information and cash flows. Therefore, the operations of most manufacturing supply chain still have room for improvement. 
In this research, a new concept of “one-stop” logistic services is proposed to provide solutions for enterprises with more integral and comprehensive services, meanwhile, it expects to improve the operational efficiency and enhance the competitiveness. This research summarizes the exact definition, scope and operational mode of the one-stop logistics services. In addition, the process models are constructed by the different needs and service model to provide for the logistics industries a developing reference. There are four divided models, which conclude respectively from Model 0 to Model 3. Furthermore, the survey of enterprises and logistics industries is conducted, verifying the importance and requirements of one-stop logistics service. This research also uses Income4 as the tool for the process design, model construction and simulation. The study collects the related data from the case company, using field data to express the logistics service model and process. Finally, the simulation is run to evaluate the benefits and difference between the as-is and to-be models. This research develops an innovative logistic solution with efficiency and customization, which hopes to help the current industrial logistics solve the current unsatisfied needs and make the logistic services more competitive and valuable.

The reliability is an important indicator in the network system, the success probability of transmission that from source node to sink node. To determine the reliability of the network system must obtain the solutions first, and the solutions can calculated the reliability of this network system.
This paper will present algorithms of calculate the deterioration-effect multi-state network reliability, and the propose methods for solving two different situations: single-MP and NSIEMde (the node-based sequential implicit enumeration method under deterioration-effect).

Semiconductor Process Improvement","Failure Mode and Effects Analysis Method (FMEA) is widely used in the semiconductor process improvement activities, including the Risk priority number (RPN) which is used to determine the impact of failure mode on the system basis. The risk priority number supports decision-makers to make the correct judgment to avoid unnecessary waste on improvement and missed opportunity to improve the high-risk crisis. But the traditional RPN method has high repetition, ineffective order comparison on Severity, Occurrence, Detection (SOD), and no account for the failure modes of each project and the failure causes, such as direct and indirect relationships. Therefore, this study proposes a method that combines Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) and Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), to solve the problem of the traditional RPN. This methodfirst uses GRA method to revise the risk priority number. In order to find the right weight between SOD and reduce RPN repetition rate; it sorts by DEMATEL method to improve the direct and indirect relationship between Failure Mode and Cause of Failure, thereby bringing the risk more close to the real needs. Finally, his method applies to two real semiconductor process improvement cases. The effectiveness evaluation through the Control Plan confirms the validity of this method which performs better than the traditional RPN, and provides more reasonable information for decision-makers as a reference."

In this thesis, we study the sampling problem in semiconductor industry and develop a mathematical model to characterize it. We use the simulation optimization technique to solve this model, and compare with multiple start schemes.  We also derive the optimal sampling policy that can achieve minimum cost.

The importance of sustainability management has become a major issue for all governments, industrial and environmental NGOs, and private sectors. Material Flow Cost Accounting (MFCA) concept is developed to evaluate both material costs and environmental impacts of products and their production. The MFCA includes the consideration of environmental impacts, material costs, and system costs simultaneously. MFCA helps organizations achieve cost reduction by identifying emissions and wastes within manufacturing process. Such precise data motivate managers to enhance material productivity and significantly reduce waste far more effectively than relying only on conventional concept and method of production cost accounting. This research focuses on developing and implementing the MFCA information management system. The system will be suitable for most of industry. The manager can use the system to analyze the MFCA report, and the system can create the MFCA XML file. The related function can download the file as a reference to realize the improvement progress. Besides, the research adds the carbon footprint module to enhance the MFCA environment impact quantized data. It will make the manager has more vision to decide the improvement strategy.

Furthermore, using traditional fossil fuel will generate more greenhouse gases causing other negative social impact. Hence, executing and promoting green energy policies have become the most important issues for governments around the world. Taiwan government also implements many new energy developing policies to change the energy structure, enhance the development of renewable energy, and reduce carbon dioxide emission. The photovoltaic industry in Taiwan is competitive because of complete supply chain and plenty semi-conductor talents. Above reasons make solar energy becomes the favorable options for implementing renewable energy. However, reducing carbon dioxide emission and promoting renewable energy needs well thought and executable policies and regulations. Many countries have taken more active actions, such as carbon tax and carbon trade. Carbon tax is levied based on the quantity of carbon generated during operations, e.g., power plant generating electricity. Therefore, how to decide a reasonable and effective tax rate is an important issue for governments. If the margin cost of reducing carbon dioxide emission is lower than the carbon tax rate, the emission sources will be effectively reduced continuously; otherwise it will not be effective in carbon reduction. As a result, government can control the tax rate to reach their goals of clean air. This research uses System Dynamics (SD) approach to evaluate the influence of carbon tax on the PV system installation and the fluctuation of electricity cost. Meanwhile, it also evaluates the allocation of tax incomes in supporting renewable energy, i.e., PV installation. We build qualitative and quantitative models using different scenarios to evaluate the potential achievements of tax incomes, emission reductions, electricity cost, and PV capacities. The results serve as valuable references for governments making decisions in renewable energy and carbon reduction policies."

In this study, 16 participants took part in a driving simulation experiment and were asked to complete the assigned tasks by controlling the Talking Car system while driving. The participants also had to answer a subjective questionnaire and sit for an interview after the experiment. By conducting the experiment, the failure modes, incorrect operations, failure causes, and effects were observed and collected. Then, a modified failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) method which took human operation into account was used to determine and analyze these failure modes and incorrect operations. After completing the analysis, the risk priority number (RPN) was computed to detect which failure had a significant effect on driving safety. RPNs and subjective questionnaires indicated that “System Dialogue with Elicitation,” “Control Button on Steering Wheel,” and “Partial System Interface” urgently need improvement. 
This study revealed significant deficiencies in the current Talking Car system. Additionally, the results also revealed that the modified FMEA method was feasible and can be proposed as a systematic technique to assess the task of controlling in-vehicle speech interaction systems while driving. Furthermore, recommendations to address the design problems of the Talking Car system are presented to facilitate driving safety.

People in the cleanroom work environment often complain about the discomforts associated with the wearing of cleanroom clothing. This study investigates the effect of wearing cleanroom clothing on physiological and subjective responses. Two experiments have been designed. The first experiment is to investigate the effect of air permeability and water vapor permeability of cleanroom clothing on subject’s physiological and subjective responses. Ten subjects participated in this study. The results indicate that skin temperature, micro-climate temperature and relative humidity were lower while wearing cleanroom clothing with high air permeability and high water vapor permeability. As the task time increased, the micro-climate temperature also increased but the micro-climate relative humidity decreased at first and then increased. In addition, the physiological responses showed significant positive correlations with the subjective perception of clothing comfort. 
The second experiment is to investigate the influence of the double-layer clothing in semiconductor manufacturing cleanroom environment. Twenty subjects participated this study. Each subject completed four treatment combinations with four different inner clothings (e.g. 100% cotton, 70% cotton + 30% polyester, 65% polyester + 35% cotton, 100% polyester). The results indicate that wearing 100% polyester inner clothing caused a significant increase in inner micro-climate relative humidity (p < 0.01). Wearing 100% cotton inner clothing caused a significant increase in both inner micro-climate relative humidity (p < 0.01), and inner clothing’s moisture absorption. Further, wearing the blending fiber inner clothing caused lower relative humidity in the inner and outer clothing micro-climate (p < 0.05). Moreover, wearing 65% polyester + 35% cotton inner clothing had higher subjective comfort than that of wearing 70% cotton + 30% polyester. 
In summary, the findings of this study provide useful information for cleanroom clothing design and selection, and the moisture absorption and water vapor transportation characteristics of the inner clothing are the major factors affecting the comfort of wearing double-layer clothing."

Decision support systems","Hybrid renewable energy system (HRES), which combines several renewable power, including photovoltaics (PV) and wind power, and a small portion of power generated by conventional power generators as backups when the renewable power is insufficient, is gaining more popularity over the decades because it has minimal impact on environment and health. However, due to the uncertain amount of power generated by the HRES, the HRES-based power supply can be very unstable. In this paper, we propose a stochastic programming model and apply an analysis methodology to ensure the robust power supply and reduce the power shortage risk for HRES when the distribution of the amount of renewable power is ambiguous. In order to validate the performance of our methodology, we create some realistic-size scenarios to test the model and the proposed analysis methodology. Results show that the instances can be efficiently solved. Finally, we create a decision support system (DSS) that integrate the proposed model and the analysis methodology is developed as an e?cient decision tool to enable e?ective and e?cient energy management of HRES. The visualized outputs of DSS allow decision makers to gain better understanding about the management of HRES, facilitating the decision making process."

However, there might be only few references linked to the documents via hyperlinks and these references usually provide limited ideas or concepts, which might cause the person to spend time on searching and filtering helpful references.
In order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness for studying and comprehending the contextual content, this research develops a model for construction and visualization of augmented reality for the contextual content. Firstly, this research analyzes a great number of target documents and identifies some reference documents corresponding to the target ones. Secondly, a model is developed for analyzing these reference documents and transforming the documents into structured ones. After that, the proposed model can be applied for analyzing the topics and evaluating the characteristics of each structured document by using the vector space model and the neural network method. Finally, the proposed model can visually display the topics and characteristics of reference documents with respect to the target one to the reader.
Based on the proposed model, this research develops a corresponding system to virtually construct the augmented reality for the target documents. Afterwards, this research designs some experiments to check the performance of the proposed model and constructed system. Consequently, the result of the experiments shows that the proposed model and system can effectively assist readers to understand the target document deeply and quickly."

Color contrast sensitivity and attention","The advanced main control room (MCR) in the nuclear power plant widely used touch function (panel) on visual display unit (VDUs) as mainly human-computer interface that provides operators highly integrated information to monitor and control system states directly on the screen. Because system complexity and potential error factor may affect the speed and accuracy of operators to read the important information on the screen, and that probably causes error, and may lead to a severe accident in the nuclear power plant. The research aimed to investigate the latent errors for improving operation performance by changing the configuration of information display format in the advanced MCR. 
    A questionnaire had been designed for important latent errors by preliminary assessment of MCR error factors and depth interviews with the operators in Lungmen nuclear power plant (NPP). The survey results showed that the intensive information display that was hard to read the text on the screen was the most important factor. Thus, we developed two strategies, 1) moving areas character to first character location, and 2) different color contrast of background areas in current interfaces, and conducted experiment based on depth interview, procedures studies, observations, and survey. And the hypothesis in this study was that the different interfaces significantly affect operation performance. In each level, participants had to follow the “control rod withdrawal criticality” procedures and deal with the events. Then, the optimal interface was suggested after analyzing operator`s performance and subjective evaluation.
    The result of this study indicated that the poor design was the most important latent error in MCR. And the experiment result showed that the condition of modified background color with different color contrast in operation procedures was found the most effective and significant in shortening the component searching time. Moreover, this improved interface was necessary to simplify the intensive information and worth to be refereed for the future interface designers of related works.

Usually the causes of these mistakes are due to a sequence of errors; however, if only reviewed the direct active errors without further investigation of indirect latent errors, the similar accident may happen again.
In this study, an analysis method is developed to find out the most important latent human error factor. By using Root Cause Analysis (RCA) method as the basic logic, Human Factor Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) as the factor source and daily check of aviation maintenance as a case study, this research dismantled the maintenance process and collected the data of each procedure. After designing the questionnaire by the preliminary factors and surveyed 115 experienced maintenance operators to do the analysis, the importance ranking of factors allows the airline to specifically design improvement plans directly, and the reference values have also been set for the use to related researches.
Here comes some sum up of conclusions in this study. First, the most important active factor is “Task execution error”, and the latent factor which has the most influence is “Maintenance capability.” Second, the combination of RCA and HFACS is an easy use method to investigate the causal inference and build the factor connection of collected data. Third, the research outcomes suggested not only the results caused by latent errors and the improvement direction, but the priorities for the improvement and the reference values of each active error factor to each step.

In comparison with visual feedback, for which there have been many empirical studies, exploration of sound has been slower, but the use of sound in websites is becoming increasingly popular due to the potential benefits it offers, and there is a great deal of general literature on how to design auditory feedback. However, scant specific guidance is available on the relationship between auditory feedback and situation. When providing unnecessary feedback, auditory feedback becomes noise that distracts the user from the task. Thus, the major purpose of this study was to investigate the role of situation in auditory feedback. 
In this investigation, we designed a website named UN.com that has three scenes and added different numbers of auditory feedback types. The independent variable was the different numbers of auditory feedback types. The dependent variable was the degree of helpfulness and annoyance. All of the earcons and auditory icons followed appropriate guidelines. 
A two-phase experiment was designed to explore the application of auditory feedback. In the first phase, the better situation in which to use auditory feedback was determined. In the second phase, a redesigned website was verified. The questionnaire consisted of three sections, the first intended to elicit demographic information from the respondents. The second section asked respondents to rate their accepted degree of auditory feedback. In the last section, we modified the system usability scale (SUS) for suitable auditory feedback to focus on the usability of auditory feedback.



We found a significant correlation between auditory feedback and website usability. Some auditory feedback emerging more frequently may have a negative effect. For example, the slip sound could be annoying when the number of occurrence exceed five times. In the last phase of the experiment, we achieved the best score in SUS. The present study enhances previous studies’ finding by providing a much more detailed examination of auditory feedback. The results may provide web designers with guidelines for auditory feedback to prevent negative effects.

For the first part, control button data from 5 brands which are the most popular cars in the market were gathered and analyzed. Then, cooperated with expert advices the control button was redesigned. In the system dialogues part, an experiment was conducted to realize the misunderstood and annoying degree of current guiding sentences. When conducting the experiment, subjects listened and rated degree of understanding and annoying for each system dialogues while driving. After all improvement, another driving simulation experiment was conducted. In this experiment, subjects need to complete the tasks assigned by controlling Talking Car while driving, and task finished time and number of error were collected to verify the effect of improvements. 
Under objective statistic data, the final result indicated that task finished time has decreased significantly. The shorter task finished time proved the system is more convenient and easy to use. With regard to evaluation of safety, reacting time of emergency brake were decreased. In consequence, the system is more suitable using in driving. And in the subjective part, subjects are more satisfied with system dialogues of novices and control button. After improvement, Talking Car is easier to use and more fit to the novices.

Also, the estimated value greatly influences the manufacture process, such as the material recipes of the crystal ingot in such industry. Minority carrier lifetimes can be used to measure the quality of solar crystal ingot and further to estimate the solar transferring rate. To our knowledge, there does not exist any effectively implementable formula measuring the solar transferring rate as functions of Minority carrier lifetimes.
This research proposes a regression function used to estimate the solar transferring rate as functions of minority carrier’s lifetimes. The proposed three significant factors in the regression function are (1) the average of the tail probability of four corners of a crystal ingot, (2) the fourth moment of the tail probability of all the crystal bars in a crystal ingot, and (3) the fourth moment of carrier lifetimes of all the cells in a same crystal bar.

The most critical manufacturing process is sewing, as it generally involves a great number of manual operations. A balanced sewing line can reduce operator requirement, increase production efficiency, decrease operator cost, and reduce production cycle time. This paper uses Grouping Genetic Algorithm (GGA) to solve types I and II Resource-Constrained Assembly Line and Worker Assignment Balancing Problem (RCALWABP) in sewing lines of apparel industry.

Type I RCALWABP in sewing lines was solved using GGA to minimize the number of workstations for a given cycle time. Type II RCALWABP was solved using GGA to minimize the cycle time and maximize the throughput for a given number of workstations. Type II RCALWABP is generally considered as the extension of Type I RCALWABP. The solution of types I and II RCALWABP in sewing lines has high practical value, but there is only limited literature in this area.

This paper takes into account several practical characteristics in apparel industry, including multi-skill operators, operator efficiency, and learning curve. Real data from apparel factories will be used to set the best parameters of GGA and evaluate GGA’s performance based on experimental design.

However, due to the uncertain output distribution, to predict the total production time is very difficult. This problem affects the delivery time of product and the customer service satisfaction. However, for manufacturers, to decide the amount of each manufacturing technique before production, is a critical to minimize the total production time. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model to characterize the problem in LED epitaxial wafer manufacturing. Based on the mathematical model, we use the simulation optimization technique to construct the response surface and use a metamodel form to characterize the objective function. We also solve this model and derive the optimal inputs that can achieve minimum the total production time.

However, articles collected from multiple search engines are great in number and complicated and readers tend to rely on their first impressions on the articles or other subjective evaluations for article selection. Under such circumstances, the important information might be missed. 
In order to solve the above problem, a comment valuation model based on comment content and structure is developed in this study. Firstly, key attributes of a comment are extracted and defined. After that, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is applied to solve the optimization model for the impact of key attributes on comment value evaluation in order to derive an optimal weight for the attributes. The derived weights can be further used to establish the relationship between key attributes and valuation indexes of comments. Values of a target comment can be calculated and visualized via the relationship model. Furthermore, real-world cases from “Mobile01” internet forum and “Yahoo!

Tags can extract concepts from content and act as navigational cues that enable users to find meaningful and relevant information. This is especially important for domain novices in understanding formal academic or scientific articles written at varying domain expertise levels. 
In this study, three topics focusing on tag technology are discussed. First study elicited differences in tag assignments by Expert and Novice groups, and discussed tag quality problems in terms of similarity and relevance measures. The results show that experts can provide a more consistent and representative set of tags for academic and scientific documents than novices can generate, suggesting that tags chosen by experts reflect better understanding of the content.
The second part of the study discusses the convergence variation of tag distributions that are affected by the social influence of a group of domain experts or a group of domain novices. This study compares three measures of the convergence rate of tagging behavior in Expert and Novice groups. The results show that the convergence rate of tagging behavior was better in the Expert group than it was in the Novice group. The one-bit comparison proposed by this research can accurately distinguish mature tags generated by experts with high consensus from other tags. 
The final part validated the effectiveness of using mature and high quality tags to facilitate self-directed learning. The experiment measured whether or not students can increase learning performance through these tags that had been extracted by domain experts. The result revealed that tags chosen by experts helped students’ better understanding of the content.
This dissertation investigates the roles of expertise during convergence of consensus of a rank-ordered tagging distribution. The results support tag-based learning and provide insights and tools toward the design of interface involving tags in the Web 2.0 environment."

The concept of community empowerment has received widespread attention worldwide because it aims to promote sustainable development by harnessing community forces.
To implement a construction plan, the government has to cooperate with constructors. From the perspective of the government, the sustainable development of the community should prevail, whereas constructors prioritize pecuniary advantages and the community cares about their own welfare. Thus, selecting and authorizing a constructor that adheres to the approach of a social enterprise is an important issue.
This study proposes an evaluation and planning models that are formulated in two phases based on four critical aspects: economy, culture, environment, and sustainability. Three social groups are involved: the government, constructors, and the community. In the first phase, an evaluation procedure is developed by using fuzzy data envelopment analysis to assess constructors. In the second phase, a community empowerment model of land-use planning is established. A developing village is adopted to implement a case study. 
Results of this study can assist the government in choosing an optimal constructor, and can support the constructor in empowering a community based on the features of the community.

Each sensor usually uses a battery to enable its function, which limits its lifetime. In order to prolong the lifetime of WSNs, it is important to schedule the sensors to be activated in WSNs, which is called the wireless sensor network scheduling problem. The WSN scheduling problem is described as follows: Given a set of sensors, and a set of regions to be monitored, each region can be monitored by a subset of the sensors, and a sensor also can monitor more than one region. In order to prolong the lifetime of WSN, we decompose the sensors into disjoint subsets such that every subset of sensors needs to monitor all the regions, i.e. activating a subset of sensors to observe all the regions in each time slot, and the number of times slots (i.e. the number of subsets of sensors), that is, the lifetime of the WSN, is maximized. 
We investigate the WSN scheduling problem in two different models, and provide several polynomial time algorithms for approximating this problem. When the monitored range of each sensor is the same, i.e. the distance r, and the distance between any two regions is at least √3 r+ε, we present a 3/4  -ratio approximation algorithm to solve the WSN scheduling problem. In addition, when every monitored region is represented by a closed area, and each sensor can monitor at most three regions, we provide a 3/8  -ratio approximation algorithm to solve this model. Moreover, we also can identify critical sensors of WSNs; a sensor is called critical if the lifetime of WSNs must decrease when the sensor is broken. The identification of critical sensors can assist the reliability analysis of wireless sensor networks.

Thus, governments need effective policies, regulations, and incentive programs to promote the usage of renewable energy. Renewable energy can be classified into different categories, including offshore and onshore wind power, photovoltaic solar, and geothermal. The policies used for promoting specific categories vary significantly. These policies depend on the policy goals, regulations, taxation, incentives and promotional schemes. The purpose of this study is to apply clustering techniques and AHP to analyze types of renewable energies and their attributes with respect to economic factors, energy resource and supply, and environmental effects.

However, the decision maker may deviate from his best response for some implicit reasons, which is called boundedly rational behaviors. Recently, fairness has been widely used to explain why the decision maker will have these incompletely rational behaviors. Cui et al. (2007) introduced fairness concerns into channel coordination in a dyadic model setting. The author showed that a simple wholesale price contract is still effective in coordinating the channel when fairness is involved. They demonstrated that the retailer would sacrifice his own profit to punish or reward the manufacturer’s wholesale price setting.
    In this thesis, we extend fairness concerns to a dual model setting, where the manufacturer can sell products to customers directly. Firstly, we analyze the retailer’s pricing strategy and find out the retailer would deviate from his profit maximized decision when the manufacturer’s wholesale price is too high or too low. Furthermore, it's discussed that the influence on manufacturers' profit brought by the different degrees of fairness the retailer requests, and we propose appropriate corresponding strategies for the manufacturer to adopt. Besides, based on the results, we find out that the dual channel setting requires less stringent condition to achieve coordination when only the retailer is fairness concerned.

However, the skills of workers might be different due to their individual experience. In this problem, the objective is to find not only an optimal schedule but also an optimal assignment of operators to minimize the makespan. Two heuristic algorithms are proposed and the computational experiments are conducted to evaluate their performance.

(3)    Traditionally, job processing times are assumed to be fixed and known over the entire process. In reality, the job processing times in many situations are not fully known in advance. As a result, fuzzy set theory provides a convenient alternative framework for modeling real-world systems mathematically. We study the parallel machine scheduling problem with fuzzy processing times and learning effects. The objective is to minimize the fuzzy makespan based on the possibility measure. Finally, we proposed two algorithms to solve the scheduling problem.

The procedure of green supplier evaluation/selection can be divided into three stages. In the first stage, a hierarchy decision framework for green supplier evaluation/selection is developed based on literatures and supplier audit forms provided by an anonymous flat panel display manufacturer in Taiwan. Then, we proposed a hybrid MCDM method to evaluate green suppliers and provided final ranking results and different opinions from each department. In the second stage, the proposed evaluation procedure is as follows: (1) to develop a decision framework by an influential network relation map (INRM); (2) to obtain the influential weights of the criteria; (3) to involve the concept of aspiration levels into the proposed methods; and (4) to evaluate and reduce the gaps of suppliers in each criterion. In the third stage, we further develop two managerial indexes: “immediate improvement degree” and “aspiration level gap” for achieving aspiration levels. Subsequently, the proposed procedure can assist the TFT-LCD manufacturer and its subsidiary to set and improve joint long-term strategic goals for achieving aspiration levels for each criterion based on the INRM. The improvement strategy includes the ranking results as well as the suppliers’ strength/weakness and the improvement priority with integrating multiple business-function perspectives. In the evaluation procedure, the managers place importance on “green management”, “technology” and “organization” aspects. This dissertation examines a subsidiary supplier of the TFT-LCD manufacturer in real-world case, and the results indicate the subsidiary supplier should improve its R&D capability immediately. Then, for the long-term perspective, the TFT-LCD manufacturer may plan to assist its subsidiary to improve the performance of health and safety, green product, delivery, current capability and quality control. Besides, its R&D capability will also subsequently be enhanced."

This paper evaluates the physiological and psychological effects of three front baby carriers with different designs. 41 people including 11 mother and their baby were recruited to participate this study. The three baby carriers were chosen because each claims to provide comfortable wearing for parents, but yet with very different design. The three different front baby carriers include, one with padded shoulder straps and padded waist-belt (A), one with two-part design and mesh fabric (B), and one with ring sling (C). 
Each subject was asked to carry two different weighted baby dummies (7kg and 10kg) using 3 different baby carriers and walking for 20 minutes. The average electromyography (EMG) of right upper trapezius, lumbar erectus spinae and rectus abdominis during walking were recorded. Skin temperature of right shoulder area and abdominal area as well as heart rate were recorded during walking. Immediately after walking, the Borg’s rating of perceived exertion scales (score: 0-10) were used to collect discomfort rating at neck, right shoulder, left shoulder, upper back, mid-back, lowback, and belly area. After the experiment, participants were asked to write a questionnaire and a Kano questionnaire.
The results showed that significant differences were found in contact area and average pressure among 3 different baby carriers. Baby carrier C had the biggest contact area and the smallest pressure. In EMG recordings, using Baby carrier B and C had higher right upper trapezius recordings than using baby carrier A. In skin temperature, using baby carrier B had higher shoulder temperature than the others. For Borg’s scale, significant differences were found in neck, right shoulder, left shoulder and upper back under different baby carriers. Using baby carrier B showed better performance than the others. Based on the findings of this study, recommendations about the improved design of baby carrier are proposed.

Among these, stitching is the most critical process because it contains many complex manufacturing processes which are not easy to be automated. A typical stitching process relies on many skilled workers to operator the stitching machines, it is the process that requires the most labors in footwear manufacturing factories. When talking to the management of stitching line, there are some issues regarding to parameters settings such as production target, batch size and human resource arrangement, etc. However, it is not easy to know which parameters setting is the optimal design for the current production line. Therefore, factory managers usually make decisions and set those parameters settings based on their past experiences.
This research plans to develop a representative simulation model for footwear stitching line and justify the effect of the different parameters settings on the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as output per day, Pairs Produced per Hour (PPH), cycle time and Work-In-Process (WIP) level. The simulation results show that different parameters settings do have significant impact on the KPIs, and through the techniques of experimental design, this research also identified the optimal parameters settings for the factory.

As customer demand become more varied and competition become fiercer, freight transportation needs to be more flexible thus still managed to be efficient. This flexibility is contradictive to the optimal cost solution, which made most of shipments is either not cost effective or dealing with high damage rate due to long shipment.

Complexity in mass customization arises from products size changes; compatibility in software development, fixtures design, augmentation of automation hardware and human-machine interface in product testing; as well as lead time for switching production, and so on. These factors cause the actual results of automation significantly different from those expected. This research discusses facing the challenges in automation for mass customization, how the manufacturers may combine key techniques of reconfigured manufacture system to promote flexibility by modularization, and generate the solutions to reform and build flexible automation system. This research explores the use of product and process modularization for flexible automation in a case analysis of production site scenario with planned product and process modularization. Production performance measures for the test automation are compared before and after product and process modularization. 
  The results show that modularization can decrease 60% of lead time in product shift. Equipment utilization will raise from 90% to 95%. In addition, output rate will improve from 89% to 93%. Further, manufacture cost will be reduce 30%. Therefore, this research provides a systematic modularization solution as strategic decision support system to manufacturers in production reconfiguration and automation.

To reduce the cost incurred in supply chain is a big issue in the supply chain management. To compose an efficient supply chain, there are several elements: procurement, transport, delivery, and distribution.
Since 2000, many researchers and enterprisers have spent a lot of time in developing an efficient supply chain, which including transportation route, supplier-choosing, and location-determining. Most importantly, the distribution way and amount should be properly determined. However, as the plants and suppliers become more miscellaneous and the network scale becomes larger, the supply chain network (SCN) problem becomes more complicated.
To make the supply chain network problem more close to reality, the paper considers the deteriorate effect. The products might lose when delivered due to deterioration, lost, theft or other factors. Hence for the sake of safety, the amount delivered tends to be different between upstream suppliers and the terminate retailers. 
This problem is considered to be an NP-hard problem, which needs an effective algorithm to solve. Currently, artificial intelligence algorithm is one of the main techniques to solve NP-hard problem. This paper presents a novel artificial intelligence algorithm named SSO to solve deteriorated SCN problem. An extend local search (ELS) strategy is embedded. SSO-ELS provides a good solution with less computational effort in ideal time. With a good solution provided by SSO-ELS, enterprisers can arrange its supply chain network system more efficiently.

Eye movement patterns are linked closely with the cognitive process of encoding information that pilots seek and perceived in the cockpit. When, how and where a pilot’s eye movements are directed determines the elements in the cockpit that are incorporated into SA. It suggests eye tracking is an appropriate and objective method for use when evaluating a pilot’s attention distribution under high stressful and dynamic flight operation. A head-mounted ASL (Applied Science Laboratory) Mobile Eye which is 76 grams in weight was used to record the eye movements during flight operation in the formal tactical fighter trainer, such as fixation, fixation duration, pupil size and saccade. This research consists of three empirical studies described in six chapters to investigate the relationship between attention distribution and eye movement patterns with a systematic research design.

The first chapter, ‘Introduction’, is to describe the background, objectives and structure of research, which is able to help readers create a panoramic view of holistic research. The second chapter, ‘Literature Review’, is focused on the previous studies and findings about attention distribution and situational awareness and the understanding of connections between cognitive process and visual behaviors. The third chapter, ‘Methodology’, is to make description in detail concerning the background of participants; the apparatus adopted; the variables of eye movements analyzed; the related hypotheses, and research design. The fourth chapter and fifth chapter are ‘Results’ and ‘Discussion’ respectively, which are edited with the progress of three studies. At final, the sixth chapter is based on the research findings, potential value and future application to formulate the ‘Conclusion and Recommendation’. 
The study-1 ascertains eye-tracking devices can aid in capturing pilots’ visual scan patterns. Also, with the assessment of pilots’ perceived workload by NASA-TLX the relationship among visual behaviors, SA performance and cognitive load during the pursuit of a stationary target was investigated. To integrate eye-tracking devices into the simulator will be a creative method for promoting SA training in flight operations. A research article based on the findings of this study-1 was published at the SCI journal of Aviation Space and Environmental Medicine 85 (7): 708-714.
The study-2 investigated pilots’ visual scan patterns in order to assess attention distribution during the pursuit of a dynamic target. The results are beneficial to the human-centered design of cockpit interface and in developing training syllabi to improve safety in flight operations. A research article based on the findings of study-2 was accepted by the SCI journal of Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance in February 2015.
The study-3 investigated the differences of pilots’ visual scans patterns and attention distributions during the pursuit of a moving target and a stationary target. The results demonstrate pilots allocate their attention distribution depending on the task characteristics and the operational environments, which will be beneficial to future research concerning interface design and syllabi development about human factors training; and in turn, in reducing in-flight perceptual errors.

There is an increasing need for further investigation of the relationship between situational awareness performance and the distribution of attention given to the interfaces by the pilot. The analysis of eye movement pattern in real-time tactical maneuvers can help system designers optimize interface displays and visual tool by grouping of information and by reducing cognitive processing time to facilitate pilots performing tactical missions. The findings of current research can help designers aware of cognitive capture during tactical operations which could have negative impact on pilot’s workload and vigilance. Furthermore, the findings can be developed for advanced simulator training syllabi of air-to-air and air-to-surface to improve pilots’ situational awareness. The application of an eye-tracking device combined with a flight simulator is a feasible and effective intervention for improving aviation training in the future."

The concept of Kano’s two-dimensional model evaluates quality attributes with the asymmetric and nonlinear relationship. In addition, classifying quality attributes in the Kano model with typical satisfaction data is another issue that people keen to know. The main objective of this study is to identify the quality attributes in the Kano model with the relationship between the attribute performance and customer satisfaction.
This study applied the clustering analysis and signal-to-noise ratio to determine the quality attribute of service or product characteristics in the Kano model. First, the related data were collected and the similarities of attributes were calculated. Second, the thresholds to group the attributes were defined. Finally, the signal-to-noise ratio of each attribute was computed and the quality attributes were identified. The proposed approach was validated using data collected from a food and beverage industry, showing that the proposed approach performs better than the regression methods and the other methods.

The SRP has several variants depending on some restrictions such as time window, multiple vessels and so on. In this research, considering the ship routing problem with multi-product, heterogeneous vessel and having loading and port constraints The problem is to find an optimal assignment of the ship routing and loading volume of demand simultaneously in order to minimize the total cost satisfy capacity of ships. 
Since SRP is an NP-hard problem, we propose a hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) to solve ship routing problem. HPSO is an improved algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) incorporated with crossover and mutation operators can provide better solving quality. The performance of the proposed method is compared with genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (HPSO). The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm exhibits good performance and solving effectiveness for the test problem.
    In the real situation, the demand of customers are not constant. It would change by temporary or seasonal demand. Therefore, we consider stochastic demands of customers. We apply optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) to allocate simulation resource. It can allocate simulation resource efficiently and reduce solving time.

The number of patients who are living alone and those with chronic diseases is increasing because of stressful life. Thus, tele-homecare service for solitary elders or chronic patients is an important issue because no one can provide timely help to subjects who live alone once they fall seriously ill or encounter an accident. Therefore, developing a tele-homecare system for this population group can assist paramedics in real-time evaluation. 
This study proposes a personalized evaluation and support care system to provide in-time care for solitary elders and home care patients. There are three roles played in this system, namely, the emergency response center (ERC), the care support agent, and the subject in need.  One database and two analytical sub-models are included in the system. (1) Personal Database: Recorded by a tele-homecare device from the subject in need. The data of each subject and the professional knowledge of doctors will be integrated to establish an individual physical record, which will be stored at the ERC. (2) Evaluation Model: Fuzzy Logic is applied to derive a real-time individual health status to provide the ERC with indicators on whether the subjects are at risk. (3) Supporting Care Model: A decision-making model based on a dispatching optimization program is established to suggest the available and most efficient ERC agent to reach the subjects and provide timely assistance.
A case study in Hsinchu is conducted to illustrate the proposed system. The result of the case study shows that this system can provide the accurate health status of a subject in need and support the ERC and available agent to provide assistance efficiently.

Compared with traditional meters read on a monthly basis, smart meters record consumption of electric energy in intervals of an hour or less. The consumption data gathered from smart meters allow electricity companies to better understand electricity usage in the future and monitor electricity supply more efficiently. 

An electricity consumption forecasting model established on the framework of support vector regression (SVR) was proposed in this study. Given that various factors affected consumption patterns, apart from historical data, weather variations and features of a particular time were also considered in this study. Based on this information, the stepwise regression analysis was applied for feature selection. However, the accuracy of the SVR model is largely dependent on the selection of the model parameters. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was proposed to determine the optimal values of parameter that improves the accuracy and efficiency of the SVR model.

The proposed procedure was demonstrated step by step to forecast the load in the north of Taiwan from November 8, 2014, to November 30, 2014 (552 hours in total). Experimental results show that this method can provide electricity forecasts with 0.70% and 2.55% of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for 1 and 24 hours ahead, respectively. This result indicates promising performance in forecasting accuracy. This model is also computationally efficient and can be applied to make predictions within 1 second.

In the contrast, the demand may increase due to seasonal or peak time. Under the fixed flight seats, hotel rooms, and cars, sellers must deny some customers when the capacities are all reserved. For consumers, they might not meet reservations on time because of some reasons, and they should have punishments. To increase the total revenue, sellers can use overbook customers to avoid loss from no-show customers. In this thesis, we construct an airline revenue management model concerning seat allocation. There are a series flights with different departure time at one day and sellers have to sell tickets by a specific time. To increase revenue, we accept the overbooked passengers and let them be transferred to next two flights. Through separating whole system into subsystems, we construct an overbooking and transference model and calculate terminal function, and then we decide the transference numbers. As the number of flights increase, the dimension of the proposed model increase sharply, so we proposed another simplified model for solving the problem. Furthermore, numerical examples are provided to show the solution procedure and the results are summarized as follows: (1) airlines can rise up revenue by transferring passengers to next flights; however, if the arrival rate is low, then the increasing amount of revenue is limited; (2) under the same arrival rate, let passengers be transferred to next two flights can have more revenue than passengers only be transferred to next flight; and (3) the overbooking limit can be estimated through marginal cost and price."

In addition, in real life situations, the costs of semi-AP may be imprecise. Also, human behavior in organization may cause uncertainty. In order to deal with these problems, we use the fuzzy number to express this uncertain situation.
    In the past, most of fuzzy transportation problems and fuzzy assignment problems use triangular fuzzy number or trapezoidal fuzzy number then transform fuzzy set to crisp set by ranking function. In this study, we define the membership function through different viewpoint instead of using triangular fuzzy number or trapezoidal fuzzy number. The membership functions include manager’s perspective and workers’ perspective; the former is a decreasing linear membership function and the latter is increasing linear membership function. This study construct the fuzzy semi-AP based on emphasizing the performance of manager and workers equally and propose an algorithm to solve the fuzzy semi-AP. The numerical example is presented to demonstrate the procedure of the proposed algorithm. Finally, we change parameters to analyze the performances of the proposed algorithm and provide some management implications.

Feature selection has wide applications for high dimensional real world situations such as cancer research in medical field.

The widely spread of wireless network, combined with technical products, have not only made information become far more available, but also changed the presentation type of information. The same information may be expressed with various kinds of media, including texts, pictures, videos, animations and audio. Multimedia combines these types of information and can be expressed through technical products.
 According to the definition of digital content industry, which was defined by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, digital content industry includes digital learning, digital platforms, multimedia tools and Ebooks. From the statistic data provided by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the industry has been growing since 2003, which shows the significant progress in the past decade. Therefore the use and design of multimedia is one of the main concerns of presenting information. Compared to simple text, multimedia information can be more interesting and attractive to readers, and further raises readers’ willingness of reading the information.
However, several researches have pointed out that higher interestingness of the information may not necessarily relate to better learning outcomes. If the media selected fail to express the key concept of the learning material, learners’ memory and comprehension would be affected. 
This research combined electronic text and image to be one multimedia reading material which was used as research material, trying to analyze readers’ visual behavior and memory of image content. Using eye tracker to record readers’ reading behavior, five indices are selected to observe readers’ visual behavior, and they are number of fixation points, percentage of fixation points, total fixation time, percentage of total fixation time, saccades between text and image. Memory of image content is accessed by questionnaire. Combining the results of memory of image content and eye-tracking indices, this research tries to understand the impact of multimedia reading materials with different relevance level of text and image on readers’ visual behavior and memory of image content.
Previous researches have regarded text as the main topic, the comprehension and recall were about the meaning of text part of the material. While in this study, images would then be treated as the main material, and readers’ memory of the image detail would be the main concern.
From the results of the experiment, participants assigned to high relevance group scored higher than participants assigned to low relevance group, which explains the effect of multimedia materials with different level of relevance. Observations from the eye tracking data revealed that all participants had correct saccades from text part to corresponding image. Combining the results of participants’ visual path with their score, this analysis revealed that participants’ scores were highly related to the level of relevance and visual path.
As for the related suggestions, future research could establish a specific indicator to support absolute judgement of relevance level between text and image, widen the range of participants’ age and access participants’ subjective feelings or attitudes toward multimedia reading material with different level of relevance with interviews, expecting to spread information through multimedia in a more effective way and provide suggestions for designing information types and multimedia learning materials.

The complexity of the problem is determined on the basis of demand and supply. Demand varies with orders, which are in turn characterized by different quantities, product types, and release times. Supply varies with the number of flexible manufacturing routes; however, this factor is constrained in a multi-line, multi-stage production system that utilizes specific types and numbers of both identical and unrelated parallel machines. This study addresses a non-deterministic polynomial-time-hard and stochastic discrete optimization problem that is subject to numerous constraints, such as product—machine dedication and lot split and merge due to charateristics of production process. Die bond, wire bond and mold were considered as bottlenecks. Due to unbalance throughput during these three stage, there is a split behavior at die bond stage, then to wire bond for reducing flow time by parallel processing; thre is a batch behavior before mold, then batch processing at mold stage due to economic scale. In the latter, jobs that belong to the same order must be processed by the same machine type at each stage under stochastic processing and sequence-dependent setup times. A simulation optimization approach is developed in view of the complex and stochastic nature of the problem. The approach includes a simulation model for performance evaluation, an optimization strategy that applies either a genetic algorithm or particle swarm optimization, and a technique for acceleration via optimal computing budget allocation. Flow time is improved because of optimal assignment in terms of production line and machine type. Scenarios depicting the different levels of demand, product mix, and lot-split size are analyzed to reveal the advantages of the proposed simulation approach. Furthermore, lot split-size (limited 2 options) is included as a decision variable and is coupled with different meta-heuristics to enhance solution quality and practical heuristics. Future research directions are then recommended on the basis of the computational results."

For example, using of fossil fuels has not only led to environmental problems such as greenhouse gas emissions, but has also significantly affected the international crude oil price, which has subsequently affected the national economy. The 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan attracted the interest of international bodies regarding nuclear energy, which has been originally regarded as a clean and safe energy resource. Based on these phenomena, the use of alternative energies must be investigated.
  The proposed Energy Supply-Mix model is a multi-objective model that measures the aspects of economy, security, and environment. This study adopts the top-down perspective to address the energy supply planning problem. The results of this model can be used by decision makers as reference when formulating policies.
  This study investigates three issues, namely, “strategic suggestion,” “optimal policy,” and “scenario analysis for critical issue.” “Strategic suggestion” is evaluated based on the current policies and by adopting the goal programming model. However, given the shortcomings of this model, including its excessive generation cost, this study develops an optimization program that derives the optimal energy supply-mix for a multi-objective problem at the lowest composite cost. The environmental issue of carbon tax is discussed via scenario analysis.
  The goal programming model provides efficient solutions for the current policies. Given the high economic costs of this model, another optimal balanced solution is devised by developing an Energy Supply-Mix model that provides an overall assessment of three aspects, namely, economy, security, and environment, under the conditions of balancing supply and demand, achieving the generation percentage of renewable energies, and satisfying the peak hour demand.
  This study takes the energy environment of Taiwan as an example and provides the efficient policies to support decision makers.

The unmelted silicon height inside the crucible of each process has to be h1, h2, h3. During the melting process, operator would determine the time to dip a quartz rod to measure the unmelted silicon height depend on his or her own experiences and record time and height. During each process, operator has to dip more than 3 times, that’s totally 9 times more to get the target height, quartz rod can only use no more than 20 times so the cost of quartz rods are high. The motivation of our research is to decrease frequency of dipping to reduce cost of quartz rods. In others words, our target is to get h1, h2, h3 by fewer dipping.

   We ?rstly ?nd the linear regression relationship between height and time from known data. The coefficient of determination of regression model is high. But in fact, if the regression model is used to estimate the target height, the estimated height will be far-o? target from real height h1, h2 , h3. So the original dipping data of time and height have to be moderately transformed. In our research, we made a clever transformation and proposed a prediction model to ?nd out the hidden part of the transformed data. The result shows dipping

Understanding user preferences over product visual aesthetics and the factors affect user experience (UX) is crucial for designers to enhance product design to fulfill the springing customer expectation. This study aims to propose a data-driven framework to capture user’s information and explain important relationships between product factors. The proposed framework consists of six stages: (1) understand and define the problem, (2) identify the niche for decision quality improvement, (3) structure the objective hierarchy to generate the alternatives, and clarify the influence relationships among uncertain events, (4) sense and describe expected outcomes, (5) overall judgments and value assessments, (6) tradeoff among the attributes and reach the decision. Two empirical studies for notebook design and wearable device have been done in Taiwan, in which the subjects with different background were recruited and selected to experience the product performance for comparison. The results may assist designers to develop product strategies based on the characteristics of consumers and product concepts related to the UX. Furthermore, it provides information to launch the products to the right customers for increasing market shares. This study has shown the practical feasibility of the proposed framework."

Multiple Dependent State Sampling Plan","Acceptance sampling plans state the required sample size for inspection and the associated acceptance or rejection criteria for lot sentencing, which have been considered as one of practical tools for quality assurance application. There are several ways to classify acceptance sampling plans. One major classification is by data, i.e., variables and attributes. When a quality characteristic is measurable on continuous scale or very low fraction of defectives, it may be appropriate to use variables sampling plan rather than attributes sampling plan. 

Several authors have incorporated Process Capability Indices（PCIs）to develop　Single Sampling plan (SSP) and Repetitive Group Sampling Plan (RGSP). Both of them are simple to operate for administration, but it does not considerate the all the available information from the collected samples. The concept of Multiple Dependent State Sampling Plan (MDSSP) has been proposed. It considers the states of the preceding lots and can provide better efficiency of inspection, but it is only developed for attributes sampling plan.

In this thesis, we overcome the disadvantages of SSP and RGSP by considering the concept of MDSSP to develop two sampling plans, called Variables Multiple Dependent State Sampling Plan（VMDSSP）and Variables Multiple Dependent State Sampling Plan Repetitive Group Sampling Plan（VMRGSSP） based on the one-sided capability index. Finally, we will summarize the advantages of the proposed variables plans over than existing variables sampling plans.

green supplier selection","Due to the increasing concern of environmental protection, many companies and academic institutions have been gradually more interested in green supply chain management (GSCM). This study develops a green supplier selection procedure to choose the appropriate suppliers. Since the green supplier selection problem consists of quantitative and qualitative criteria, many researches apply Elimination and Choice Expressing the Reality III (ELECTRE III) which allows that quantitative data are evaluated together with qualitative data. However, for the traditional ELECTRE III method, it is a difficult and arduous task to decide the indifference threshold, preference threshold, as well as veto threshold. Therefore, the main purpose of this research is to modify ELECTRE III method, which eliminates these subjective thresholds by using aspirational level and the worst level. We also adjust the discrimination threshold to provide more useful results. Besides, this study uses modified Analytic Network Process (ANP) to compute weights of criteria, it can deal with the problems of dependence and feedback between criteria and dimensions, which can also provide suggestions to improve suppliers’ performance. In the meanwhile, we use sensitivity analysis to show the range of weights which would affect suppliers’ ranking. Furthermore, this study applies the green supplier selection procedure to a case study of a Taiwanese TFT-LCD Company. As the results, the method not only ranks the suppliers but gives suppliers recommendations."

Most existing acceptance sampling plans were developed mainly based on the product defective rate or process yield. However, the yield management does not distinguish among the product that fall inside of the specification limits. The process loss index   was proposed for measuring process performance by considering the concept of quality loss function introduced by Dr. Genichi Taguchi. This thesis based on process loss index   developed an acceptance sampling system contains two acceptance sampling plans: tightened inspection and normal inspection. The first sampling procedure needs to begin from tightened inspection, and switch to normal inspection if   lots in a raw are all accepted. If there is an additional lot is rejected in the next   lots after a rejection under normal inspection, it needs to switch to tightened inspection. The acceptance sampling system observes the switching condition from tightened inspection to normal inspection and switch back to tightened inspection, so it is also called “Tightened-Normal-Tightened Sampling System （TNT Sampling System）”.
The behavior of the proposed three types sampling system:  TNT-(nT=mnN,nN;k), TNT-(nT,nN;k) and TNT-(n;kT,kN)  are investigated and discussed in this paper. The results for sampling systems indicate that the proposed sampling system gives the desired protection with smaller sample size than traditional variables single sample plan. Lastly, we analyzed a practical case to assist users to learn more from the proposed sampling system.

However, the current techniques are applied to the general prediction tasks without the ability to deal with such specific data characteristics. Both density bagging and bin-resampling techniques are developed respectively to solve the long-tailed regression problem. However, both two techniques pay for accuracy in the head and even the central part of the long-tailed distribution. This thesis addresses two different hybrid methods corresponding to density bagging and bin-resampling respectively, which can improve the prediction performance for the tail part of the long-tailed distribution without sacrificing more prediction accuracy for the head and even the central part. Three datasets are finally taken to evaluate the performance of our proposed techniques and their hybrid methods respectively and compared with several ensemble methods.

A data characteristic of a specific attribute distortion problem indicates that an observe outcome of an instance corresponding to an input attribute is not always the true outcome in real world applications. We develop a state populate bagging to solve the specific attribute distortion in classification analysis. We first transform several true datasets into observed datasets according to the distortion matrices corresponding to their specific attributes, and afterwards transform each one of them into a possible true dataset according the reverse distortion matrices. Next step is to sample several same size sets with replacement on each one of possible true datasets. State populate bagging with two voting layers not only practices an observed outcome into possible true outcomes but also captures ensemble gain for any classifying algorithms without limiting to only a specific one. Finally, several true data sets from UCI machine repository are taken to reverse true data sets into observed data sets, and afterwards we evaluate the performance of state populate bagging and compared with several benchmark algorithms."

Process Capability Indices
Lifetime performance index","In today’s highly developed manufacturing industry, Process capability indices (PCIs) are effective means of measuring process performance. Most process capability indices have been developed under the assumption that the quality characteristics are normally distributed. However, the lifetime of electronic components generally may possess an exponential, gamma or Weibull distribution and so forth. A lifetime performance index CL was proposed and used as a means of measuring product lifetime performance. The lifetime of products is a larger-the-better type quality characteristic and is generally required to exceed L unit times. 
Acceptance sampling plans provide the producer and the customer a general decision rule for lot sentencing that meets both of their quality and risk requirements. This thesis attempts to introduce two variables sampling plan for product acceptance determination based on the lifetime performance index. One is developed under the exponential complete data; the other sampling plan is developed under gamma complete data. The probability of acceptance, i.e., the operating characteristic function of the proposed sampling plan, is derived based on the exact sampling distribution of the estimator of the lifetime performance index. The required sample size n and the corresponding critical value k are determined by solving two non-linear equations simultaneously. Furthermore, a comparison study is also conducted to compare the proposed CL based sampling plan and the existing sampling plan. And for the practical purpose, this study tabulated the plan parameters for various combinations of acceptable and rejectable quality levels, producer’s risks and consumer’s risks. Thus, practitioners can easily understand the number of product items required for inspection and the corresponding critical value for making decisions on product acceptance determination. Finally, an application is given for illustration.

Fidelity represented the degree to which a simulation replicates reality. Because of FMS contains lots of system characteristics and flexibilities, and there are many different fidelity models exist which considerd different system features.
Evaluating system via higher fidelity model can be more accurately, but it will cause time-consuming and will bring higher cost. Although lower fidelity model may suffered bias, but faster evaluation and the performance can provide partial of trend between low and high fidelity models. It is important to enhance the efficiency of optimization by using multi-fidelity models.
In MO2TOS, applied an inappropriate sampling method will lead a poor quality of optimization. Hence Adaptive Sampling is proposed to update the sampling method by sample correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient can present the trend between multi-fidelity models, updating the sampling method according to the sample correlation coefficient can enhance the efficiency of optimization and save 45.39% and 22.71% of simulation resources for higher and lower correlation models. 
Grouping method is one of main factors which may affect the quality of optimization significantly. In this research, Adaptive Grouping is proposed to update the group after every iteration of MO2TOS. It may significantly enhance the gap between groups, further to allocate resource effectively and save 28.45% and 17.94 of simulation resources for higher and lower correlation models."

Taguchi’s Quality Philosophy","Acceptance sampling plan is a practical tool in quality management field. It can provide the vendor and the buyer a decision rule for lot sentencing to meet their requirements of product quality. Several acceptance sampling plans have been developed by using different strategies, one of them is quick switching sampling system (QSS system). QSS system is one of two-plan sampling systems, which involves only normal and tightened inspections and has a rule for switching between these two types of inspection. The normal inspection can be used when the quality is found to be good and tightened inspection is used when the quality of a product deteriorated.
Traditional acceptance sampling plan always focus on conforming to specification limits, but according to modern quality improvement theories or Taguchi’s quality philosophy, reduction of deviation from the target value should serve as the guiding principle rather than conforming to specification limits. And this concept can reduce the loss caused by the deviation.
For this reason, this paper develops a variables QSS system based on process loss index Le. Because QSS system has three different types, we will study each of them. Moreover, the behavior of the proposed plan under various parameters is studied and the plan parameters are determined by an optimization problem. The advantages of the proposed plan are discussed compared with the existing plans using the process loss function. Finally, an application example is presented for illustration and discussion."

On the other hand, some of non-practice entities (NPE) often use patents as a weapon to seek patent licensing and patent commercialization aggressively. For instance, in the mobile communication industry, there are many NPEs initiated patent lawsuits against manufacturer. A patent infringement lawsuit in the courts can be a very lengthy process, and the cost is extremely expensive. In order to avoid the NPE’s patent infringement litigations and understand the patterns of NPE's legal actions and the disputed patent trends, this research uses a NPE called “Wi-LAN” as an example and focuses on developing Modified Formal Concept Analysis (MFCA) approach to explore two levels of evolutions with respect to the IP infringement lawsuits and their disputed patents. Two MFCA models are constructed to observe the evolution of litigation and the disputed patents, the inter-related trends and developments. The disputed patents are grouped based on the common sets of disputed patents in the same group of litigations, and then illustrate the evolution progress of each group respectively. Finally, CPC classification is used to search the patents that similar with the disputed patents. The research provides the mobile communication manufactures with the analyses of related patents NPE holds to prevent infringement from re-occurring. Further, the research provides mobile communication industry with additional IPR references based on the litigation evolutions, the disputed patent trends, and their similar patents for future R&D directions and IP management strategies."

This study considered the font size and font lightness of Google Glass to determine the best setting of user interface elements in see-through head-mounted display and investigate the usability in different application situations. 
In here, the reading completion time, error rate, and the subjective measures including SUS and NASA-TLX were collected. Then, the critical fusion frequency value and eye fatigue scale were collected to evaluate the differences of visual fatigue after reading articles using Google Glass. Lastly, the users are invited to assess the overall feelings and preference through interview.
The results indicated that the completion time of women was better than men. The font size, font lightness and reading situation showed significant effects on reading performance and subjective comfort level. In static situation, the best font size was 24 pt and the best font lightness was 165. In dynamic situation, the best font size was 32 pt and the best font lightness was 210. From the overall evaluation, the study observed that the font size must be greater than 24 pt, 32 pt was the best font size and font lightness must be brighter than 165, and 210 was the best. In addition, the results also indicated when users are reading on Google Glass at a static situation, the measures in eye fatigue, usability and mental workload were better than those in a dynamic reading situation. The results of this study can provide very important reference information for interface design of Google glass related products.

In this research we study a three-stage hybrid flow shop production system, with several unrelated parallel machine groups at each stage, and there are some identical parallel machines at each machine group. We consider that processing time is stochastic, and each product type has its eligible machine groups. To reduce mean completion time, lot split would be used in this production system. Each order would be separated into several sublots to reduce flow time by the overlapping of operations.
    All in all, this research would discuss two issues, lot split and machine group assignment. Lot split is that each order would be separated into several equal size sublots, and we look for suitable quantity. Machine group assignment is that each order would be assigned to eligible machine groups at each stage. We simultaneously consider lot split and machine group assignment, so that solution space is too large. We use genetic algorithm to search for suitable solution. From the result, we find that lot split is useful to mean completion time, and variable lot split performs better than consistent lot split. In addition, we take stochastic processing time into condition, and it spends many times to reduce the sampling variability. Therefore, we use optimal computing budget allocation to improve efficiency. Computation results indicate that it reduces 76% simulation times by using OCBA.

Kansei engineering considered personal cognition factors and physiological signals in user-oriented design. Based on this, this study aims to investigate and identify the music characteristics which can relax people and which comprise the most soothing music for therapeutic application. Our research used fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering during analysis and conducted experiments to classify music accordingly. Results show that music with a low amplitude variability (in the range of 96-to-128 beats per minute (BPM)) generates the optimal positive feelings that can soothe the body and mind. With an eye toward developing this methodology as a promising new service for therapeutic music design, this study employed questionnaires and heart rate variability (HRV) signals to examine user experience (UX) at the products/service design stages. Our findings align with HRV data to confirm the consistency in psychology and physiology. A majority of study participants indicated they were drawn to the pragmatic elements of the endeavor.

The mishandling of baggage is a critical problem to airport and airlines. With the strong growth of the flight, the unloading area in Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport (TPE) is no longer enough. To increase the number of processible flights in the unloading zone, TPE will change the unloading belt lateral to carousel. Carousel has bigger capacity which is enough to carry the baggage of more than two flights. With this change TPE can dealing with the problem of capacity not enough.   
More than one flight arranged to the same carousel may have overlapping of their unloading period. When the carousel is arranged too much flights which of their unloading period is overlapping, it will make the ground staff hard to separate the baggage of different flight, and will also make the carousel overladen. To avoid this situation happening, the arrangement of the flight unloading zone should be very careful.
In this paper, we propose “Overlapping Time” as the main performance of unloading zone allocation problem. Under the premise that all the flights are allocated to a carousel, find the best allocation to reduce the working loading of ground staff. Due to the complicate of this problem, we propose to use Genetic Algorithm (GA) to generate the allocation. 
To be more similar to the real system, we consider the stochastic of the flight unloading period. The unloading period will be affected by the airline constrain, the destination of the flight, and the baggage number of the flight. According to this three factors, we separated all the weekly flight into different groups, and figure out the distribution of their unloading period.

In contrast to the mass production, the advantage of mass customization can increase product variety, and satisfy most of customers. However, there are some limitations in mass customization. Firstly, customers do not completely participate with designers in the design phase. Secondly, the concept of mass customization is not able to satisfy every individual’s requirements and not capable of providing personalized services and goods. In order to overcome the gap between mass customization and mass personalization, this study proposes a service engineering methodology to break through the limitations of mass customization and finally design personalized services through customer co-creation.

Fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and petroleum) account for 90% of non-renewable energy source. However, the combustion of fossil fuels is the major source of pollutants which will result in greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. Taiwan government has enacted the Statute for Renewable Energy Development, which guarantees that the public who own renewable electricity generation facilities, such as roof-top solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, will receive a fixed price for all of the electricity they generate for a contract term of twenty years. For government, how to set the appropriate feed-in tariff (FIT) rates is the major issue because the low FIT rates will make it unattractive to invest in renewable energy but the high FIT rate will cause government's financial burden. 
Therefore, in order to investigate if the current renewable energy promotion policies in Taiwan can make energy demand, environmental concerns and economic considerations (E3) reach balance, this research adopts system dynamics (SD) approach to develop an analysis model to evaluate FIT policy. The impacts of FIT on solar PV installed capacities, carbon dioxide emissions and energy dependency on imports are all considered. There are lots of energy-related platforms providing various energy data with different storage format. Therefore, with the concept of information integration, this research establishes a data warehouse (DW) to store and manage historical energy data collected from global energy platform. However, different decision-making models require various data dimensions, so the multi-dimensional data cubes should be built according to analysis model. In this research, the DW is built based on star-type data cube design, which provides comprehensive view of information. The data can be queried and then used as input data to plot the data trend using line graphs. It is necessary to understand and compare the data from different perceptions before analysis. Then, the data can be used as the input data of SD model with SQL syntax.
The SD model simulates the scenarios of policies for promoting renewable energy which reference the FIT rate of Germany and Spain. The simulation results show that the adoption of Germany FIT policy (where FIT declines at 1% annually) will effectively reduce the cost of carbon reduction and energy dependency on imports. Therefore, a gradual decline in FIT rates would be a better choice. The SD simulation results are valuable reference for governments to adjust the appropriate FIT rates."

Angle network reliability","In current decades, we used the network reliability widely into several realistic situations. In practical application, the transmitting utility may be restricted by specific swerve angle i.e., automated guided vehicle, the oil transmission system and military robot. Hence, a novel binary-state network (BN)/multi-state flow network (MFN) model called the 2D binary-state angle network (2DBAN)/2D multi-state flow angle network (2DMFAN), in which each arc has a probability of different capacity as well as each node has a specific swerve angle restriction, is offered to deal with those realistic problems. An efficient algorithm constructed with the cosine law and Euclidean distance formula is introduced in searching for all minimal path set at capacity level d (d-MPs) which is a simple path satisfied all angle restrictions and capacity level d to the sink node from the source node in 2DBAN/2DMFAN. We can calculate the reliability of a 2DBAN/2DMFAN by all MPs (d-MPs) satisfy the swerve angle restriction. Finally, we use some examples to illustrate how the reliability of a 2DBAN and 2DMFAN are evaluated using the proposed algorithm."

If there is a shutdown during operation, the stability and productivity will suffer a huge impact. It will directly affect the competitiveness of enterprises. Therefore, focusing on early prevention and instant diagnosis to maintain large transformers is the best important EAM of enterprises. However, with the significant increase of civil and industrial electricity consumption, the number of large transformers also increased. So, in order to solve the problem such as managing the big data generate by a large number of transformers. This paper integrates a Data Warehouse technology to establish fault diagnosis system.
 The system using transformer related data to establish different data cubes in Data Warehouse. These data cubes are applied for OLAP analysis in various decision support modules by using Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) code. Decision support modules including condition monitoring module, failure diagnostic module and intelligent diagnose module. Condition monitoring module will use the MDX code to provide multidimensional reports and graphical visualization of statistics. Further failure diagnostic module using three international dissolved gas analysis (DGA) methods, i.e., Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and Electric Technology Research Association Japan (ETRAJ). Using MDX code’s statistic strength to integrate in these DGA methods’ diagnose step can help transformer maintainers find high potential faulty period. Finally, Intelligent diagnose module using MDX code to query multidimensional data cube to be the inputting parameters of Back Propagation Artificial Neural Network (BPANN) algorithm. Asset managers can diagnose potential transformer malfunctions and provide maintenance suggestions by using this system. The research methodology and system modules are evaluated and verified with real data from a series of 161 kV transformers in operations. 
This research focused on Data Warehouse technology application. The Data Warehouse technology is good at processing multidimensional data and can store great amount of data. It can help analyzers understand the data before making decision. The method used in this research can widely apply in many different fields, e.g., manufacturing, marketing and energy related fields.

The congenitally blind","With the development of computer technology, the ability to type gradually has become an important skill in this generation, and it also provides the blind a new access to interact with others. Although the blind can type in Chinese with sound-decoded input method like Zhu Yin, they experience great difficulty in selecting the correct characters and words of the same pronunciation. Consequently, their overall learning, interpersonal interaction, and career development suffer from frequent typos, leaving them even more difficult to integrate into the society. 
Therefore, this study aimed to solve the problem with a new learning model. First, the participants learned the category of Chinese character structure with the tactile pictogram designed in this study and voice feedback from the screen reader. Then, the characters’ meaning and their association with Boshiamy code were interpreted in the instructions in order to help them memorize the decoding. Furthermore, the concept of strokes was explained by the examples of Chinese components with less than five strokes. Besides, the assistive mechanisms such as the available distant-communication access and instant assistance from the accompanier were designed for solving problems encountered by the participants during the experiments. To examine their performance, the dependent variables included the number of typos, typing accuracy, and the speed at which the subjects type the characters. In the second phase, we further tracked the performance of two chosen children with the regulation of Techficiency Quotient Certification (TQC) entry level and a component writing test.
Based on the statistical analysis and questionnaire results, the participants’ accuracy and their confidence in typing Chinese characters improved. Moreover, the study revealed that the adult participants experienced limited progression due to problems adapting to the system whereas, conversely, the accuracy rate of the children was significantly enhanced. The result showed that both subjects’ typing accuracy and speed of Boshiamy were greatly improved and even surpassed those of their original methods after four months from the intensive instruction. To conclude, under the learning model, the participants not only established fundamental Chinese recognition but also enhanced efficiency, efficacy and satisfaction on typing task.

Usually, the control factors in system is set by engineer’s experience. If the factors is set carefully, the storage could store more baggage for the problem.
The paper used simulation to analyze control factors in an airport baggage handling system. First, we will discuss with what control factor is in system and how to improve the storage. Besides, we collect a lot of data to avoid the special condition make the deviation. According to the analysis, time window setting of each buffer is one of important control factor. It will affect the numbers of baggage with manual operation. Therefore, in order to minimize the numbers of baggage with manual operation we used simulation optimization to solve the storage problem by time window setting of each buffer. Because of lots of solutions and time consuming we combine with genetic algorithm and optimal computing budget allocation to search the good solution.
Compare with original setting, the new setting can reduce almost 200 of baggage with manual operation. The input baggage profile is different from weeks. According to characteristic of each week, we provide different setting of time window setting of each buffer for policymaker to solve the problem."

Each order has a time window delimited by its ready date and due date. The processing time of an order is expected to lie within its time window. If not, penalties for earliness or tardiness will occur. If the start time of an order can be scheduled later than its ready date, the earliness is zero. Otherwise, the earliness of an order is calculated by subtract the start time from the ready date. Whereas, if the completion time of an order can be scheduled before its due date, the tardiness is zero. Otherwise, the tardiness of an order is calculated by subtract the due date from the completion time. In addition, machine eligibility is also taken into consideration; that is, not all of the parallel machines can be assigned to process a particular job.
To the best of our knowledge, no existing literature has thoroughly addressed such a scheduling problem. Three solution methods, the hard-constraint mixed integer programming (HCMIP), the earliness-tardiness mixed integer programming (ETMIP), and the heuristics-initialized mixed integer programming (HIMIP), are proposed and tested by experiments. Generally speaking, HIMIP is most effective in solving the problem. Further, based on the experimental results, a multi-stage optimization (MSO) procedure is proposed."

Process capability indices are convenient and powerful tools for measuring process performance and it is widely used in Acceptance sampling plans. 
    This paper attempts to develop a Variables Quick Switching Sampling System（VQSS System）based on the Cpk index. The VQSS System consists of two inspection plan along with a set of switching rules between them. The first sampling plan, called normal inspection plan, is applied for periods with good quality. The second sampling plan, called tightened inspection plan, is applied for use during problems encountered periods.
    The probabilities of acceptance under normal inspection and tightened inspection are derived, and the proposed VQSS System is also developed based on the exact sampling distribution rather than approximation approach. Three types of the proposed plan parameters are determined by solving a non-linear optimization problem with two-point conditions on the OC curve. The behavior and performance of the proposed sampling system is discussed and also compared with the conventional variables sampling plans. Finally, tables of the plan parameters for various selected quality levels and risks are provided for practical applications.

Batch production is highly used in chemical process industries such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, food processing, etc. A few typical characteristics common in these industries are the long setup time and the long cleaning time. To minimize the cost and the frequency needed for the changeovers, the plants are operated in campaign mode. However, the products are often sold in small quantities with the fluctuating demands, the multi-purpose plants are preferred. While the multi-purpose plants gains the flexibility for the production planning, it becomes much more complex to decide how to run the plants, when and in what amount of different product should be made. In this paper, we study the planning problem in pharmaceutical industry and build a mathematical and decision model to characterize it. An empirical study is conducted to demonstrate the viability of the proposed model.

However, some types of business or the company shipping methods are different from the above. The distribution centers must ship goods to all customers in its cluster or cluster in a cycle time, such as postman, newsman, etc., this approach of shipping is called “one-time delivery”. One-time delivery can be modeled as a Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). This type of problem is rarely discussed in the former literature. 
In order to solve this practical problem, a new hybrid clustering algorithm, Simplified Swarm Optimization combining with K-harmonic means (SSOKHM) is proposed in this paper for the CCP with one-time delivery and using greedy algorithm for the TSP to find the shortest loop and obtain the target: minimize shipping costs. An exchange local search is an inspection mechanism which adds after greedy algorithm. Proposed method is applied to several facility location problems from OR library and compared with other hybrid clustering algorithm.

From a practical perspective, the problem discusses the shortestpath query problem with a set of dynamic changes that are subject to online traffic conditions. In comparison with prior work, we design efficient algorithms for solving this problem without the assumption that the given time-dependent networks satisfy the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) property. Moreover, we conduct empirical studies with high-density time-series traffic data and exploit data structures to significantly reduce computation loads. In fact, the size of the resulting sets of preprocessed data structures might be too heavy to be practical. Our approaches can immediately respond to online traffic changes, but in small real-world instances. We also propose some heuristics to speed up computation, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. In particular, the travel cost of the derived online near-shortest routes can be shown very close to that of the static (offline) time-dependent shortest paths in hindsight, where all traffic changes are known a priori."

In such many kinds of adverse event, medication safety is one of main concern. Unappreciated used of drug treatment not only will threat patient lives but crush medical system and social structure and heavy the financial loading of hospital and government. It’s important to enhance drug safety through medication adverse event (MAE) collected from reporting system. The main purposes of this research are to investigate nurses’ cognition of MAE and the way they report MAE, also find out the reasons and factors behind their report and the way they look at event.
    Researcher constructed open-end scenario report, subjective ranking scale and semi-structure individual interview. The open-end scenario report is based on real medication adverse events. Through the analysis of nurses reporting models of MAE and the missed items in their reports, researcher calculated the integrity and effectiveness score. The semi-structure individual interview will used to investigate the reasons behind reporting models, reporting criterion and other MAE concepts of nurses. At last, the subjective ranking scale is designed for importance ranking of reporting needed items in reporting system.
    Researcher recruited 30 nurses to be participants in formal experiment. All participants were divided into 3 groups based on their working years: 9 participants for senior group, 11 participants for middle working experience group, 10 participants for junior group. In the result part, nurses reporting models could be divided into four types: “integrated report” (report with full case description, wrong doing and correction and improvement), “partial report” (report with part case description, wrong doing and correction and improvement), “review report” (report with wrong doing and correction and improvement), and “event report” (report with full case description). The middle working experience group use “integrated report” the most, and then is junior group. The senior group is prone to use “review report”. The reasons may have relevance with “reporting system design”, “training” and “report time interval”. The integrity and effectiveness score among three groups aren’t statistical significantly different, but the middle working experience group performed higher score trend than others. The reporting models, the complexity of scenarios and the experiment time may lead to this kind of results. The reasons of missing items are “dependence of click system”, “poor reporting habit” and “reporting experience” and “fatigue mental condition”. In the cause analysis part, all participants could focus on personal factors, but less than half of participants could focus on multi-personal factors, and only 28% could focus on systematic factors. Researcher infers that nurses’ concept of cause analysis which is generally not systematic oriented will causes the percentage distribution. In the subjective ranking scale part, participants think that information related to MAE, correction and patient first aid are the most important.
    Based on the results, Medical adverse event reporting should focus on reporting system design and reporting culture. Reporting system design should apply ergonomics design, reporter should understand the meaning of reported items while they’re using the system. Reporting system should also avoid making user depend too much and weakening own ability of organizing report and emphasize the items reporter thinks are important. Report culture should focus on the change of patient safety culture inside medical institution. The change patient safety culture will affect staffs attitude and behavior. Training should focus on the construction of nurses’ concepts, and make them realize the importance, meaning and purpose of each reported item. Elevate front-line nurse reporting quality will do a lot on medical safety improvement.

Virtual Try-On","Progressing rapidly in recent years, augmented reality (AR) technologies have successfully found applications in engineering, marketing, entertainment, and medical industries. However, to render high-quality visualization contents in AR remains a challenging task with several technical barriers. Recent development of RGB-D cameras may provide an effective approach to solving those difficulties by capturing real-time depth data of a real scene. This research attempts to improve the effectiveness of product display in AR from multiple perspectives. First, a virtual model can be precisely positioned into a real scene according to the reference geometry selected by users from the scene, without use of markers. Mutual occlusions between real and virtual objects can be precisely estimated using the depth data. This information enables realistic interactions in an AR environment with intuitive rendering of both. In addition, a computational framework is developed to overcome data deterioration induced by random noises and missing pixels in the data captured by RGB-D cameras. The framework effectively reduces the jitter problem occurring along the occlusion boundaries. In addition, we implement a distributed AR system to realize the concept of mass virtual try-on. This system integrates cloud computing and parallel processing technologies to increase the computation efficiency involving in the try-on application. A use scenario of shoes try-on demonstrates the feasibility of the system. This work enhances the realistic extent of interactions between real and virtual contents by integrating RGB-D cameras into AR applications."

The most common ways to annotate things in crowdsourcing applications are “Like/unlike”, “Five-star” ratings, “Emoticons” and “Text” tags or comments. However, the annotating method used on phone calls is limited to “Text” in existing system.
     In this study, we compared the four annotating methods and tried to figure out the most suitable method in crowdsourcing annotation system on phone calls for smartphone users. There are two main goals in this study, the first goal is to find the usage patterns of annotating and investigate the feelings on different kind of calls by analyzing the massive call annotations being collected. The second goal is to establish a predictive model on call feelings.
     We developed a crowdsourcing annotation system on Android, and collected more than 3,000 user profiles and 100,000 annotations. We compared the four methods on this system and studied the primary audience, user behavior on annotating and efficiency of collecting annotations. In addition, the predictive models on call feeling achieved 73.6% accuracy on average, which is higher than that of the other studies.
     Overall, this study provides a foundation for follow-up studies in the field of crowdsourcing annotation on phone calls, and the established predictive model can be widely used in estimating customer satisfaction on calls and improving phone-call-related applications.

The main purpose is to revise product designs according to the evaluation result, thus satisfying customer requirements. Traditional design evaluation is usually conducted on real product prototypes, which involves high development costs and lengthy development time. As information technologies progressing, virtual prototyping technologies have recently becomes mature and been applied to design evaluation of various products and services. A design evaluation task needs to be studied from multiple perspectives . It is thus advantageous to understand if and what differences exist in design evaluations based on real and virtual prototypes, especially in the user experience arising during the evaluation process. Detailed studies are still lacking in previous works. Therefore, this research compares the differences between real and virtual prototypes by conducting a series of cognition experiments. In the first part of the experiments, we look into the evaluation correctness on identifying engineering attributes, usability, and product appearances, respectively, between the two means. Another focus is to examine the user experiences in the corresponding evaluation tasks. In the second part, we try to understand how the feedback information of different degrees influences the user experience in evaluating virtual prototypes. The experimental results show that the evaluation correctness based on virtual prototypes is lower than that of real ones in most tasks, and the user experience is worse. Moreover, adding sound or movement feedback in virtual prototypes improves the user experience in the evaluation task based on virtual prototypes, and the more feedback information, the closer to that produced by real prototypes. This work systematically investigates design evaluations based on real and virtual prototypes. The research findings provide good guidelines for improving virtual prototyping technologies."

In this paper, we consider its online version, called the online traveling salesman problem (OLTSP). The difference between TSP and OLTSP is that requests arrive at arbitrary time and no advance information about the requests is known a priori. The salesman moves at unit speed to serve all requests arrived online and goes back to a designated origin. The objective of the OLTSP is to find a route for the salesman that finishes his work as quickly as possible.      
In this paper, we refer to the concept of fair adversary proposed by [Blom et al. INFORMS Journal on Computing, (2001), 13(2), pp. 138-148] and determine how to use waiting strategy properly. We consider two cases: the real line and the boundary of unit square, respectively. For the 1D space, i.e., the real line, we prove that the PQR algorithm presented by [Ausiello et al. Algorithmica, (2001), 29(4), pp. 560-581] has a better 5/3-competitive ratio against fair adversary. We also show that for any randomized algorithms, the lower bound is at least  4/3. For 2D space, i.e., the boundary of unit square, we provide a 2-competitive randomized algorithm against fair adversary, which can be improved to 1.7808, by using the waiting strategy. This result surpasses the deterministic lower bound of the 2D OLTSP.

The problem involves assigning a set of n items with size no more than the given bin capacity to equal-capacity bins so that the total size of items in each bin does not exceed the bin capacity, and items may depart from the packing at any time. The optimization objective is to minimize the maximum number of bins ever used over all time. In the perspective of practice, this problem has widely studied for the memory allocation problems. Therefore, many variants have been continually proposed over the past decades. In this study, we revisit the properties of some on-line algorithms in the dynamic bin packing problem and investigate a generalization model of the bin packing problem, called semi-online dynamic bin packing. The semi-online property provides some relaxations of on-line constraints, such as allowing to repack some items or knowing some information in advance.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of using the EEG power and mean amplitude indices to measure visual fatigue and mental workload. Two-stage experiments are included in this study. In the first experiment, three common visual fatigue measures, critical-flicker fusion (CFF), near-point accommodation (NPA) and subjective eye-fatigue rating (questionnaire) were used to compare with the EEG power index. The subjects were 20 men with a mean age of 20.4 years (SD=1.46). The experimental task was a 120 min car-racing video game. Results indicated that the EEG power indices were valid as a visual fatigue measure and the sensitivity was higher than the subjective measure. The EEG β and EEG α power indices were effective for measuring visual fatigue in short and long-duration tasks, respectively. The EEG β/α was the most effective power index for the visual fatigue measure in this experiment. 
The second experiment aimed to identify EEG mean amplitude indices that can accurately monitor mental workload while subjects performed multiple tasks with the strategy of maintaining stable performance and maximizing accuracy. 30 male subjects completed three 10 min multitasks with 3 workload levels. 25 mental workload measures including 10 EEG mean amplitude indices (α, β, θ, α/θ, θ/β from O1-O2 and F4-C4), heart rate, 12 heart rate variability (HRV) indices, and 2 subjective measures data were collected. One-way ANOVA with repeated measures, Pearson correlation and Duncan post-hoc test were employed to observe index sensitivity. The results showed that EEG θ, α/θ (F4-C4), and SDNN, VLF, LF, %HF, LF/HF are sensitive to differentiated high workload levels. EEG α/θ (F4-C4) and LF/HF are most effective for monitoring high mental workload. EEG α/θ (F4-C4) showed strong correlations with subjective measures across different mental workload levels. Additionally, we found the operation strategy would affect the sensitivity of EEG α (F4-C4) and HF. 
These findings identified the EEG measure are valid in measuring visual fatigue and mental workload. Besides, the task characteristic and operation strategy might affect the validity of EEG indices. The results, furthermore, can be applied to enhance the safety, health, and comfort of the users involved in heavy visual requirement and mental workload tasks.

Half-Face Respiratory Masks
real 3-D craniofacial data","This research is aimed to provide a method for designing a half-facial respiratory mask based on real 3-D craniofacial data. In addition to the filtration capability of the filtration material, two of the most important factors that affect the performance of a respiratory mask are the airtightness and dead space. The airtightness is the degree of seal between the mask and the face of the mask wearer. The dead space is the space enclosed between the mask and the face, which could detains the tidal volume of the wearer and lower the effective permeability of the filtration material. To enhance the airtightness and lower the dead space, this research proposes a method for designing a half-facial respiratory mask based on 3-D craniofacial data. Furthermore, it is inclined to design a respiratory mask with a limited number of sizes (e.g. 3 to 5 sizes) for all of the users (e.g. 8 million labors). This research proposes a method for sorting the sizes of face based on the size and depth of the face.
Based on this airtight design concept proposed by 楊宜學, this research further proposes an improved two-step method for sorting the facial sizes into groups. This method first sort the parent group into groups based on the facial sizes (e.g. group M), and uses the external contour line of the mask and the real 2-D curve (which is different from two 1-D sizes such as the facial length size and the facial width size) as the basis for sorting. Next, the 2D external contour line is projected to the 3D face and thus derives the fitting interface curve between the 3D mask and the face. Afterwards, the degree of depth distribution of this 3D fitting interface curve is used as the basis for sorting the facial depth. The facial size groups are further sorted into N groups. This two-step sorting method is used for designing a set of airtight and low dead space respiratory masks by sorting manner according to a limited number of facial sizes, so as to be applicable to all of the wearers.
The results reveal that the external contour line of the 2-D mask based on the facial size is distributed between 90.04mm to 120.08mm in face length, the full pitch is 30.04mm, and the allowance value of the facial size is 20mm (±10mm). Therefore, the facial sizes are sorted to two groups, that is, size S group and size L group. Next, these two groups are sorted based on the facial depth according to the 3D fitting interface curve. It can be known from the spread curve of the size S group has a depth distributed between 4.6mm and 23.59mmm, the full pitch is 18.99mm, and the allowance value of the facial depth is about 14mm (±7mm). So the facial depth Size S group is further sorted into two groups. ”shallow size”:4.6mm~14.095mm and”deep size”:14.095mm~23.59mm. Likewise, the spread curve of size L group has a depth ranged between 4.6mm and 23.59mm, the full pitch is 18.99mm, and the allowance value of the facial depth is 14mm (±7mm). So the facial depth Size L group is further sorted into two groups. ”shallow size”:4.6mm~14.095mm and”deep size”:14.095mm~23.59mm. Next, we find the person whose facial size is proximate to the middle value as a standard person for all of the sizes. Based on the craniofacial data of this standard person and the airtight design concept of 楊宜學, we capture the 3D fitting curve of the standard person and construct the mask to meet the requirements of airtightness and low dead space. In accordance with the computer simulation, the requirements on airtightness are met for four size groups. The maximum dead space volume according to the computer simulation is 192ml, and the minimum dead space volume of the marketable products measured by real water syringe is 237ml which means that the dead space volume is lowered by 45ml.  Certainly, this result must be verified with real products.
Methodologically, the design of the respiratory mask of this research is actually a design method for a real 3D mask. This design is different from the conventional mask which is achieved with reference to simplified 1D size such as the 1D facial length size and the 1D facial width size, such that the conventional mask lost the complex 3D information. The design method of this research is achieved by directly capturing 3D fitting curve from the curved surface in the 3D craniofacial data, while the 3D information is substantially reserved. This method is applicable to other designs, for example, helmets, spectacles, and shoes.

This study presents two novel algorithms based on simplified swarm optimization to deal with the drawbacks of KM and KHM, respectively.
In addition, with the advance of internet and information technologies, the data size is increasing explosively and many existing clustering approaches including KM and KHM are inefficiency for dealing with the large-size problem.

A long-term shipping plan from warehouses to retail stores can be obtained by the transportation problem. Since the parameters of the transportation usually are estimators, a sensitivity analysis is usually adopted to realize the perturbations of parameters to the shipping plan. In addition, if decision maker has a budget to improve the shipping plan in short-term, sensitivity analysis can address the problem that how to reallocate the resources. Many papers in the literatures point out the influences of degenerate optimal solutions to the traditional sensitivity analysis, then propose advanced sensitivity analysis. However, most papers mention about advanced sensitivity analysis of a linear programming problem, but a few papers mention about advanced sensitivity analysis of the transportation problem. In addition, papers in the literature propose the auxiliary reduced model to obtain the perturbation ranges of advanced sensitivity analysis. Once the number of warehouses and retail stores increase, the computational time would increase dramatically. In this dissertation, three major issues are addressed: (1) Type II sensitivity analysis of cost coefficients of the degenerate transportation problem; (2) Optimal-routes invariant sensitivity analysis for supplies and demands when dual optimal solutions are degenerate; (3) Type III sensitivity analysis for right-hand-side parameters in the transportation problem with dual degenerate optimal solutions. We propose the auxiliary reduced models and observe some properties of each auxiliary reduced model, then develop the algorithms with labeling procedure to address the above issues, and consider the observed properties in the procedures of the algorithms. The computational results show that the proposed algorithms can provide more complete perturbation ranges to decision makers.

First, obtaining critical value and sample size by solving two non-linear equations. Secondly, data analysis and decision-making. Lastly, comparing different variables sampling plans by operating characteristic (OC) curve and average sample size (ASN). The plan parameters are determined by solving two non-linear equations simultaneously and fulfill the two-point condition on the OC curve. The OC curve of all the proposed plans in this paper is derived under the exact sampling distribution.

That is, context relationship between the related documents is not employed to determine the rank.  As a result, readers have to spend more time to understand the document contents or face difficulties in understanding the documents. In order to solve the problems, this research analyzes a great number of documents and generalizes the relationship between document characteristics and document categories. On the basis of the analysis results, this research develops a model for context relationship analysis of multiple documents. By using the proposed model, characteristics and categories of documents can be identified by using determinant vectors. Finally, the documents can be sorted and the context relationship of documents can be visually displayed for reading.

Most process capability indices have been developed under the assumption that the quality characteristics are normally distributed. However, the lifetime data of products generally may possess an exponential, gamma or Weibull distribution and so forth. A lifetime performance index   was proposed and used as a means of measuring performance of product lifetime, which is a larger-the-better type quality characteristic and usually possess a non-normal distribution.
Acceptance sampling plans are practical tools for quality management applications and provide the producer and the consumer a general rule for lot sentencing to meet their requirements of product quality. And an acceptance sampling plan for lifetime performance is also called life-test sampling plan. In this study, we developed life-test sampling plans based on the lifetime performance index   for Weibull lifetime products in the conditions of complete sampling data and upper record data.
And for the practical purpose, this study tabulated the plan parameters for various combinations of acceptable and rejectable quality levels, producer’s risks and consumer’s risks. Thus, practitioners can easily understand the number of product items required for inspection and the corresponding critical value for making decisions on product acceptance determination. Finally, life testing procedures are provided to illustrate the use of the developed life-test sampling plan."

simulation","As the increasing complexity of semiconductor manufacturing, AMHS plays an important role to deal with the transport and storage of wafer lots in a 300mm wafer fab. As the tool layout and AMHS track design was confirmed, the next phase of AMHS design is to determine the optimum number of vehicle fleet size and stocker bin capacity with refer to transport demand and performance measure request. Finally, to deploy and implement the material control system (MCS) to manage AMHS vehicle management control (e.g. vehicle dispatching, vehicle allocation, vehicle types, vehicle routing, and congestion/deadlock control) for daily operations.
In order to improve the transport performance, fab managers continuously modify MCS vehicle management method to reduce vehicle waiting time and transport time of the wafer lot. Many researchers have paid efforts to propose the approaches in vehicle dispatching, vehicle routing, and congestion or deadlock control. However, there are few researches to address the other MCS vehicle management problem, e.g. vehicle allocation control. In a large-scale wafer fab, there are many intrabays and over hundreds of vehicle moving within or between intrabays. With the uncertainty involved in wafer lot movement, dynamically allocating vehicles to each intrabay is very difficult. Furthermore, in the current vehicle dispatching system, MCS only dispatches one vehicle for one load port at a time but this method cannot reduce the vehicle waiting time for one load port which has more than two transport jobs to move by AMHS. In this dissertation, two vehicle management strategies was proposed to reduce the vehicle waiting time of the wafer lot and improve AMHS system effectiveness.
In the first study, a dynamic vehicle allocation control (DVAC) method is proposed for a connecting transport AMHS in a 300mm wafer fab. The objective is to minimize the sum of the expected long-run average transport job waiting cost. An interesting exhaustive structure in the optimal vehicle allocation control is found in accordance with the Markov decision model. Based on this exhaustive structure, an efficient algorithm is developed to solve the vehicle allocation control problem numerically. The performance of the proposed method is verified by a simulation study. Compared with other methods, the DVAC method can significantly reduce the waiting cost of wafer lots for AMHS vehicle transportation. The control policy can help fab managers to enhance MCS vehicle control logic to reduce the empty vehicle arrival time.
In the second study, a pre-dispatching vehicle (PDV) method is proposed to simultaneously call several empty vehicles to move to a load port for executing transport jobs at a time. In semiconductor manufacturing, a furnace tool has a long processing time of 6 h to 12 h, thus making its operation a form-batch manufacturing step. With this application, wafer lots are temporarily stored in stockers, and delivery to furnace tools for processing is executed when the work-in-process (WIP) level reaches four to six lots. Unlike current methods, where empty vehicles are sequentially assigned for movement to load ports, the PDV method simultaneously calls several empty vehicles to move to a load port with refer to available empty vehicles and pre-dispatching vehicle quantity. This finding is useful for fab managers to explore the possibility of applying the PDV method to other areas and to continuously reduce the vehicle waiting time of the wafer lot.

Process capability indices are effective means of measuring process performance. Most process capability indices have been developed under the assumption that the quality characteristics are normally distributed. However, the voltage, stickiness and lifetime of products generally may possess an non-normal distribution. People are interesting in the lifetime of products so a lifetime performance index CL was proposed and used as a means of measuring product lifetime performance. 
In the era of high quality, use traditional testing methods need more costs, so acceptance sampling plans are widely used by industry to do the inspection. It protects the risks of producer and customer, reduce the sample size, effectively reflect the quality and provides a decision criteria about accepting the product or not. This study considers the product lifetime with a gamma distribution and uses the uniformly minimum-variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) of the lifetime performance index to develop resubmitted and repetitive group sampling plans. For the practical purpose, this study presents a step-by-step procedure and tabulates the plan parameters for various combinations of acceptable, rejectable quality levels, producer’s and consumer’s risks and shape parameter. Thus, practitioners can easily know the number of product required for inspection and the corresponding critical value for decision making. Furthermore, this study also uses the results to compare with the single sampling plans. Lastly, provide a practical example to illustrate how to apply this acceptance sampling plans.

Otherwise, we analysis and discuss the performance of the proposed variables plans compared with the existing sampling plans including single sampling plan and repetitive group sampling plan.

However, many hidden factors in the advanced manufacturing processes could cause defects on the panel and result in low product quality. Simply relying on the domain knowledge or rules of thumb is unable to clarify the root causes of quality problems effectively. 
This study applies data mining techniques for the detection of large-sized TFT-LCD Frame Mura defects issue, and proposes a general procedure for attribute selection. Four data mining techniques, including back-propagation neural network (BPNN), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), and rough set theory (RST), are used to select the important attributes from the data to detect Frame Mura defects. In the end, we aggregate the selected frequency of each attribute to determine the relative importance of attributes and provide improvement priorities for the decision makers.
The proposed process was employed to analyze the manufacturing data of a TFT-LCD company in Taiwan. The implementation results showed that five key attributes were identified from the original data and the reduced model still retained the ability to perform well in classification, which demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed procedure.

There’s no difference between computer group and tablet group in paragraph-integrating strategy, but both groups use more paragraph-integrating strategy than paper group. There’s no difference among three groups in global integrating strategy. Although there’s no significant difference among three groups in reading time, it takes 20% less in paper group than tablet and computer groups. There’s no difference in comprehension level among three groups. Paper is the favorite reading medium and participants think they comprehend better while using paper instead of other media. On the other hand, tablet is the least favored reading media. Subjective comprehension level shows no difference between tablet group and computer group.

  Eye-tracking results found tablet is more close to paper reading than computer. However, participants scored least on tablet of preference. It might because participants more often use computers to read instead of tablets that makes them dislike tablets more. Future studies can work on interaction of reading material and reading media."

3D Head Database","Previous researches have pointed that the primary leakage of respiratory masks originated from the misfit in the nasal and menton regions. Recent studies on the design of mask using 3D anthropometry data have achieved promising result. A newly proposed two-stage sizing method is first to segment the whole user population into “large” and “small” size groups on face size against individual’s objective allowance, then 3D face seal line for every subject within each size group are extracted, and all the 3D face seal lines are registered on both ends (on nasal and menton landmarks) and superimposed, viewing from the side all the lines exhibit a series of line (like magnetic lines) arisen from both ends, the variation of these curve line are then further segmented into 2 depth groups against depth allowance of the elasticity of the mask skirt. However, this method does not particularly address the leakage problem arises in the bony regions for their non-pliant sharp curve and bony tissue. As a consequence, this study is undertaken to investigate the variance of 3D curve lines of the interface seal in the bony regions of nasal and menton for the refinement of the shape and deformation range of the mask skirt.
Based on the result of this newly method, the e-constructed mask is fitted on Solidworks software for each subject within each group to check the goodness of fit. Some mis-fits were observed: the mask skirt in nasal region was too narrow for the widest subject (46.6mm) and too shallow for the highest subject (21.7mm); in menton region, it was too wide for the narrowest subject (76mm). Thus, the subject with maximum and minimum of nasal width, nasal height, and menton width was identified as reference to refine the shape and measurements of the mask skirt. The maximum width and height of nasal was used to determine the shape of hard shell, and the minimum width and height of nasal was used to determine the shape of the mask skirt; similarly, the maximum width of menton was used to determine the shape of hard shell, and the minimum width of menton was used to determine the shape of the mask skirt. After refinement, the fit was significantly improved."

nonlinear multi-objective programming","With the rise in electricity demand, energy security and climate change have become imperative problems. To reach the goal of sustainable development, each country has embarked on the development of renewable energy and demand side management. In demand side management, demand response helps an electric utility company to deal with the wide variation of electricity consumption throughout the day. Recently, Time-of-Use is a common and effective demand response program which encourages the modification of consumption ways in both existing traditional grid and developing smart grid. The equalized daily consumption curve can postpone the construction of new generation units, lower generation costs, and increase both reliability and efficiency of the supply system. Based on these ideas, this study aims to help the electric utility company decide Time-of-Use prices.
To deal with a Time-of-Use pricing problem from the viewpoint of the electric utility company, this study proposes a differential pricing model in the form of nonlinear multi-objective programming to determine Time-of-Use prices. The estimated hourly consumption, which reacts to Time-of-Use prices, can also be derived from the model. In the model, the objectives are to equalize consumption throughout the day and reduce the environmental impact of daily consumption while considering business development and consumer satisfaction. To describe consumer satisfaction, an integrated consumer satisfaction in response to each electricity price is presented by considering the three types of consumers, namely, aggressive, neutral, and passive consumers. To solve the multi-objective programming model, multi-objective functions are transformed into a single objective function by the weighted sum method.
An illustrative case of Time-of-Use pricing in Taiwan is used to verify the proposed model. The results show that the suggested electricity prices can benefit both the electric utility company and consumers. The benefits can be exemplified by the minimal range of the estimated hourly consumption and the minimal estimated daily carbon dioxide emissions. Sensitivity analysis is conducted on the consumer satisfaction level to provide the electric utility company information related to the trade-off between consumer satisfaction and the objectives. The results of this study can assist the electric utility company in formulating a promising decision on setting Time-of-Use prices."

The grating relief mark is a patch of horizontal lines of 8 cm high and 11 cm wide. By printing the marks on the left (short) edge of the banknotes with 1 patch, 2 patches and continuous patches without apace, it is able to code the banknotes into 3 denominations. Then, the same coding pattern is printed onto the top (long) edge, another 3 denominations is coded. These 6 denominations is then further doubled into 12 by coded with two sizes of grating stroke widths, the thicker one is 0.76mm wide (space 2.91mm); and the thinner one is the width 0.39mm wide (space 0.76mm). The relief height is 60μ. Compromising between the minimum fulfilments of 7 denominations of the Euro, against the constraint of that 12 denominations must require significant duration of learning and adaptation, the study finally determined to print 9 denominations for this study.
    The study consists of a denominations sorting and real transaction experiment. The experiment group is the simulation banknote; the control group is the New Taiwan Dollar (5 denominations). Subjects are full blinds, 17males and 3 females. The denomination sorting requires that the subject to sort a pile of 90 randomly shuffled banknotes into 9 stacks of 10 each. The real transaction requires the subject to pay the exact amount of money from a stack of randomly shuffled banknotes upon the oral request of the experimenter (e.g. the amount is $5030). The experimental variables are correct rate and judgement time for a single banknote. The statistical analyses consist of the simple statistics of 2 variables, and T-test of the simulate banknotes with the New Taiwan dollar.
The results show that for the sorting experiment, the correct rate and judgement time on simulation banknotes is 98.2 %( 3%), and 7.96s (0.84s), it’s better than the New Taiwan dollar of (71.1%) ,and 13.86s(0.84s). For the real transaction, the correct rate and judgement time on simulation banknotes is 97.3 %( 4%), and 141s (97s), it is also better than 54.2% (9%), 422s (325s) of the New Taiwan dollar. Besides on correct rate, the judgement time has very obviously difference under the T-test statistical analysis.
The result of the study is promising. The number of denomination for the simulate banknotes is as high as 9, the correct rate is quite approaching to 100%, suggesting that the petition of “Without relying on any aid, whether others or assistive devices are able to independently identify the denomination of banknotes” is achievable, even though that the judgement time has not reached a satisfactory threshold in performing professional duty. In fact, most of countries are under 6 denominations in their banknotes system. If using the way by redundant coding, regrouping the grating relief marks, number of the marks and deposition of banknote, taking 12 coding lower to 6 coding, the expected correct rate and judgement time will be better.

The 0-1 MKP is a NP-hard problem; that is, no polynomial algorithm for any NP-hard problem has yet been found. Hence, various population-based search algorithms are applied to solve these problems.
Particle swarm optimization (PSO), which is an efficient population-based optimization algorithm, is based on the metaphors of social interaction and communication (e.g., fish schooling and bird flocking). In the classic PSO model, the cognition learning factor and social learning factor are constant. Thus, it is easy for particles to get trapped in the local optimum. Therefore, this dissertation proposes three novel binary PSO algorithms with dynamic learning factors to prevent particles from being trapped in the local optimum and improves the quality of the solutions of the 0-1 MKPs. The computational results have shown that the proposed algorithms are capable of finding the optimal or near optimal solutions and can outperform the other existing BPSO algorithms in a reasonable time for solving low- and high-dimensional 0-1 MKPs from OR-Library.

 The purpose of the study is to know unmet needs and HCI issues for social networking applications on wearables. Through 30 questionnaire, taking eight representative users to generate Persona, especially in user pain points. In addition, using hands-on wearables test to recommend how interaction models could be.
The result of the unmet needs are mainly in ""Do not miss important messages "", ""Do not see the message does not need to hurry"", ""Do not want to respond immediately"" and so on. In the hands-on, sending messages by voice is the most accepted method and standard reply is not common acceptable. Message reminds by vibration is the most acceptable way, but only the retired group dislike it. A few users recommend to have “checking if new messages” function on wearables.
In message display function, message is usually too long to completely display on the wearable screen. Most users said that the incomplete message is still useful, since people could judge if take the mobile phone for the complete message. For the retired group, small text is not acceptable, converting to a voice message output could be useful. Other features are recommended, such as an emergency call function, video chat, and social message transferring to calendar reminder.
In this paper, the qualitative method is used to explore ideas of social application on wearables. For future study, quantitative research methods are highly recommended. In addition, understanding the reason behind the needs can be used to expand the design considerations of different product/services. Moreover, heavy users of social application still considered negative behavior. Researchers could consider different designs of interview to know more on this kind of users."

In a multi-agent scheduling problem, the set of jobs is divided into several subsets. There are several agents, each interested in a subset of jobs and has its own objective. In this paper flow shop scheduling problem with two agents is considered, in which the processing sequence of all jobs is to be determined. Each job belongs to either of the agents, the objective function of agent 1 is the makespan of its jobs and agent 2 is the total tardiness of its jobs. Two agents have to compete on the use of common processing resources. Every agent’s objective must be considered in the scheduling of jobs and the final schedule must be acceptable to all agents.
Two agents’ objectives are measured in Pareto optimality and final result is a set of Pareto optimal scheduling solutions. A simulation model including information of machines, jobs and agents is constructed to evaluate performances. The search of optimal solutions in problems with large feasible solution space is through Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization. Due to the low convergence of MOPSO, we propose new swarm setting, position updating, personal best position updating and initialization operations based on two-agent features. The improved new algorithm is called Agent-based MOPSO. The parameter analysis is conducted to determine the best parameter combination in searching efficiency and solution quality.
In the end, two MOPSO algorithms are compared with Variable Neighborhood Search in two-agent flow shop scheduling problem. Results show that Agent-based MOPSO performs better than the other two algorithms in distance metric, space metric and diversity metric in this problem.

These enterprises face critical challenges recently, such as high labor cost and diverse shoes-type orders. It is necessary for footwear industry to focus on how to response for variation rapidly, increase productivity, and reduce cost.
This research developed a multi-site order management simulation model for footwear manufacturing. One that can consider the capacity burden of each plant and the product type differences, and then makes the appropriate allocation to maintain high production performance. First, the workload estimation module (WEM) estimates the time period of the bottleneck that will be used by each order. Thus, it provides the loading information of bottleneck. Then, the order assignment module (OAM) picks out the candidate orders that may fit the capacity requirement to the bottleneck by using the results of the workload estimation module. Finally, the performance evaluation module (PEM) reflects the impact on the manufacturing system resulting from order exchange with production performance including bottleneck utilization, makespan and lateness.
The simulation results show that different combinations with different levels of these control factors lead to different production performance according to which response decision makers are trying to optimize. Through the technique of experimental design, this research also justify the effect of different parameter settings on the production performance such as bottleneck utilization."

This capacity planning system can assign orders to production lines by considering stocks in inventory and number of production loss due to initial machine setup quality checking, and process characteristics. Moreover, it can also plan order release time, and balance machine loading. This can be accomplished by implementing five major modules in the capacity planning system: Order Treatment Module (OTM), Order Priority Module (OPM), Lot Release Module (LRM), Workload Accumulation Module (WAM), and Workload Balance Module (WBM).
CPS results indicated that CPS could effectively reduce overcapacity. Additionally, experimental design is used to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed CPS with various factors and levels. There are five factors considered (number of orders, order size, order size variance, order priority and balance policy) and the responses of this experimental analysis are machine workload balance, order due date deviation and lateness. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to evaluate the factors in accordance to the responses. Moreover, the optimal settings for the control factors under 8 combinations of different environment factors are also evaluated. This can assist decision makers to use the optimal settings of control factors to generate the best favorable response under different environment factors.

The EC enterprises usually adopt electronic payment (e-payment) methods to settle financial transactions among merchants and customers. A successful e-payment service creates new business opportunities and requires patent protection to prevent infringement from competitors. This research develops a computer-assisted approach incorporating text-mining method to classify each patent and visualize patent portfolios using roadmaps to explore novelty and possible strategic information of EC enterprises. The framework first constructs the e-payment ontology and identifies the key term library of each ontology element by experts. The next step is to use computer-assisted method to extract key terms of each patent based on frequently appeared terms from primary and Derwent World Patent Index (DWPI) patent information. After key term extraction, this research matches each patent with the libraries and maps onto roadmaps to visualize patent portfolios.

These issues can lead to time-consuming computation and lower classification and prediction performance. Support vector machines (SVM) are the most popular classifier with optimal mathematical theoretical foundation. However, the disadvantage of SVM is that representation of decision boundaries are complex mathematical formulation, which increase the difficulty for people to comprehend their implications. Therefore, it is desired to construct a rule extraction algorithm from SVM to enhance their explanatory abilities.

    The study proposed an integration of SVM and gene expression programming (GEP), used support vectors (SVs) on the decision boundaries of SVM as the possible solutions space of GEP chromosome to extract rules for enhancing explanatory abilities of the black box model of SVM. Moreover, three performance metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, were adopted to evaluate the classification performances of the proposed method and other classifiers. For UCI datasets, the results showed that the classification performances of SVM + GEP were better than that of the other three, which verified that the method had an excellent classification property.

In the meantime, the Government actively fulfilled the carbon reduction target and electricity stable supply policy under three major principles of international carbon reduction commitment without restricting electricity usage and with a valid electricity price. Consequently, the Government encourages private enterprises to generate electric power by renewable energy and sell back to the public enterprise.
　　This study proposes a two-stage analytical model to support private enterprises in evaluating the possible generation combination of renewable energy while considering the intermittence of renewable energy, environmental protection, generation cost, and given the monthly electricity demand. The model involves a parameter evaluation model developed to determine the capacity factor of renewable energies. A multi-objective model is also proposed to optimize the mixed generation of renewable energies, and minimize the carbon emission at a minimum cost. By substituting the result obtained from parameter evaluation models, the three goals can be achieved under the condition of balancing supply and demand for each month.
　　A case study of optimal mixed-generation of renewable energies was carried out at the National Tsing Hua University to illustrate and verify the proposed system. From parameter evaluation of solar energy, it can be observed that because the variation of capacity factor is attributed to performance ratio, the capacity factor and solar irradiance is highly correlated. As regard the wind energy, the capacity factor is proportional to the cube root mean of wind speed, so it will increase very fast respect to the high wind speed. The external cost of energy source remains a specific proportion of total cost in our optimal combination of energy sources, since each energy resource has a different carbon emission coefficient. At last, we perform sensitivity analysis to discuss the cost trend of energy sources under different carbon tax."

Second, the proposed decision-based manufacturing agent has the capability of adaptive, flexibility, coordination, decision-making to provide promptly production while abnormal events arise. The decision-based manufacturing agent could coordinate and communicate with others function modules and agents to integrate information and provide possible solutions for those disturb events. Thus, the decision maker could consult the possible solutions and do the final decision to access those disturb events, and let the production system return to normal operation.
Three empirical cases are demonstrated to validate the proposed decision-based intelligent manufacturing system in this study. First, a multiobjective scheduling problem in TFT-LCD module assembly process is proposed that consider manufacturing conditions in shop floor. The multiobjective scheduling module used multi-objective hybrid genetic algorithm (MO-HGA) to solve multiple and conflicting production objectives, minimizing makespan, minimizing the weighted number of tardy jobs, and minimizing the total machine setup time, that are directly related to productivity and customer satisfaction. Second, a manufacturing disturb case in TFT-LCD module assembly process. When an abnormal event happened in tuffy glue coating process, decision agent was trigged that communicated with other agents to exchange information and understand the latest status. Then, decision agent could provide the possible solutions for decision makers for final judge. Third, a manpower allocation and route planning problem for manual material handling system (MMHS) in a 200mm wafer fab is proposed. The manufacturing resource allocation module used a novel route planning approach to utilize the routes that reduce the technician traveling distance and transportation time. And it also used manpower loading evaluation model is developed for determining the appropriate number of technicians that all improve the MMHS efficiency and productivity.

Importance sampling","Redundancy allocation problem (RAP) has been an active research area for the past decades. Generalized redundancy allocation problem (GRAP) extends it to a more realistic situation where the system can have a complex network structure, for example, its components are connected with each other neither in series nor in parallel but in some logical relationship. Because of that, solving GRAP has presented major challenges in practice. In this paper, we propose a simulation optimization method, called Nested Partitions for Reliability Optimization (NPRO), to solve GRAP efficiently. Due to a newly-developed partitioning strategy, NPRO can locate the optimal solution in an efficient manner. The incorporation of many useful techniques, including the proposed encoding approach, importance sampling (IS) and Latin hypercube sampling (LHS), further enables NPRO to reduce the number of simulation observations needed in the optimization process, facilitating quick generation of the optimal solution. An extensive numerical experiment is conducted to verify the efficacy and efficiency of NPRO. Results show that NPRO can find the optimal or nearly optimal solution of GRAP within limited computational budget and moreover, it significantly outperforms the other two existing algorithms."

sampling resources allocation","This research focuses on the problems of Simultaneous Scheduling of Machines and AGVs in FMS. According to the problem, different system characteristics will affect the performance of system. In FMS, there are most multi-functions CNC machines, so same process in one work can choose the alternative machines to do. This characteristic can increase the flexibility of scheduling more. Alternative machines affect the makespan and the using percentage of machines and AGVs. In past researches, when using Mathematical Programming to solve simultaneous scheduling problem, transportation time of AGVs is the transportation distance divided by the speed of the AGV. It didn’t consider the actual problems that AGVs will delay or be in Deadlock due to the congestion during the transportation. Therefore, for the problems of Simultaneous scheduling of Machines and AGVs in FMS, this research constructs the discrete event simulation to achieve actual conditions, and use zone-control to deal with the problems that lead to deadlock.
If the research considers more system characteristics, the fidelities of system will increase too. So, when considers the condition of alternative machines and zone control, there will be two low-fidelity models and one high-fidelity model. This research will cite the Multi-fidelity Optimization with Ordinal Transformation and Optimal Sampling (MO2TOS) optimization framework. It will effectively use the relationship between low-fidelity models and high-fidelity model to solve the problems of simultaneous machines and vehicles scheduling in FMS.
There are four sampling methods in MO2TOS framework (Greedy、Random、Hybrid、Adaptive Sampling). Because there are some relationships between models but not completely unrelated, using Greedy Sampling may consume less computing cost in high-fidelity model and have higher success rate to choose the best design than other methods. Greedy Sampling can also apply in other different FMS environments.
In the MO2TOS framework, if great and bad designs are included in the same group, it may lead the mean performance of group to be worse. In the consequence, less sampling resources will be allocated into the group, a risk that can’t choose the best design may happen. So, this research further optimize the allocation methods of sampling resources in high-fidelity model. Use the performance of the best design in every group to be eigenvalue to conduct the sampling resources allocation will effectively allocate the sampling resources to critical groups and saving the sampling resources.

foot positioning
foot-eye coordination","Taiwan is changing from an aging society to an aged society very rapidly. The prevention of falls hence becomes one of the most critical issues. There have been many studies focusing on the risk factors of falls, among which the gait patterns of older adults were highlighted. However, the use of foot-eye coordination during walking also plays an important role. As found by previous studies, older adults with high risks of falls often transferred their gaze away from the target earlier, which leads to decreased accuracy of foot positioning. If gaze transfer is not allowed until heel-strike on the target, the more accurate foot positioning may help reduce the risk of falls due to trips or loss of balance.
Ten older adults ranging from 55 to 65 years old and ten young adults ranging from 22 to 24 years old will be recruited in this study. Each participant is required to wear the eye-tracking system and the electromagnetic tracking system, so as to collect the eye movement parameters and gait data. There are two targets placed along the pathway. The first target is placed on a fixed position, while the second one is placed either one-step, two-step, or three-step away from the first one. The participant needs to walk forward while stepping on the first target and then the second target respectively. Under condition 1, the participant is required to keep looking at the first target until heel-strike on it, whereas no instruction is given to the second target. Under condition 2, the participant has to follow the instruction of foot-eye coordination for both targets. By comparing the differences in positioning error and task completion time between the two conditions, it can help determine whether the strategy of visual guidance takes effect over time. However, eye gaze on the target the pathway should be as important as on the environment in order not to make collision with other objects. So the next step is to find out the best timing when visual guidance should be triggered and terminated. The ten elder adults mentioned earlier participated in this experiment again. There are three targets fixed placed the pathway, Under condition 1, the participant is required to look at each target during the heel-strike of leading foot until heel-strike of the trailing foot on it, Under condition 2, the participant is required to look at each target during the foot-flat of leading foot until heel-strike on it. Under condition 3, the participant is required to looking at each target during the toe off of trailing foot until heel-strike on it.
In the first experiment, the results show that foot positioning error is greater both in condition 1 than in condition 2, and in elder than in younger adults. In other words, visual guidance can’t take effect over time. Reminder of this strategy would be hence required during walking. In the second experiment, the results show that the best timing of visual guidance is to be triggered at the foot-flat of leading foot. In the future, the findings may serve as a reference for clinical applications to improve the safety of older adults in the home environment.

Therefore, this study aims to investigate the musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) associated with blood samplingamong medical technologists through the use of  subjective questionnaire and objective evaluationtools.   
 The NMQ (Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire)results of 37 participants showed that the prevalence of the overall MSDs is 97.3%. Among the few body parts, the prevalence of MSDs is highest at shoulders(83.8%), followed by neck (81.1%), hands or wrists(62.2%), waist or lower back (59.5%), upper back (45.9%), and elbows(40.5%). Considering the effects of individual backgrouns and working conditions, one’s gender, height, weight, and BMI, frequency of staying up, alcohol use, exercise intensity, overall seniority, seniority of current job, and working days per week have influence on the prevalence of MSDs. In addition, four ergonomic checklists were employed to assess the risks of MSDs. The results of MSDs checklistindicated higher risks at neck and shoulders, fingers, wrists, elbows, and back. The results of BRIEF showed higher risks at neck, back, left elbow, left shoulder, right hand, right wrist, right elbow and right shoulder. Results of RULA showed higher risks at neck, trunk, wrists, upper arms and forearms. ART revealed higher risks at neck, arms, wrists, fingers, and back. Among them, the analysis results of MSDs are more consistent with that of NMQ, followed by RULA, BRIEF, and ART. This suggests thatthe MSDs analysis can be replacedby NMQ, which saves some more time for the analysis with other checklists.   
Overall, the major risk factors of blood drawing process are the repeated tasks and imadequatebody posturesbeing performed while checking the test items and insertingthe health insurance card at registration, verifying barcodes and tearing off the tags of  
barcodes, preparing needles and sample tubes, decontaminating the patient’s skin, inserting the needle, pulling out the needle, and taking off the needle from the needle base. It is recommended to reallocate the manpower and redesign the working environment, so as to reduce the risks of MSDs induced by blood sampling among medical technologists.

The Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) was be used to obtain the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders, A total of 20 responses were received,with the response rate of 100%. The results indicated that 85.1% of the sample consciously perceivemusculoskeletal discomfort.The most uncomfortable body parts were the lower back (55.0%), neck (45.0%), shoulder (30.0%), hand and wrist (30.0%). The results of  Chi-Square analysis showed that there existed significant correlations between the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders and the Age, BMI, fregrenly ofstay-up, fregrenly of smoking, experience of wrrent positionand overall work experience.
The results of the MSDs checklist analysis revealed that hand and wrist, back and neck werewith higher risk of musculoskeletal disorders.The results of the BRIEF checklist analysis revealed that neck, shoulder, back and elbow were with high risk.OWAS identified 14.8% of operations into AC2 and 7.4% of operations into AC3, which required corrective actions soon or immediately.The results of the QEC checklist analysis revealed that back, neck, shoulder and arm (81.8% for extremely-high or high) required ergonomics intervention to reduce the exposure levels.In terms of consistercy with NMQ, OWAS outperformed MSDs, BRIEF and QEC.In other words, OWAS can be replaced by NMQ, which saves time for the evaluation with other analysis tools.
The potential reasons for musculoskeletal discomfort in medical radiological technologists were awkward working posture and repetitive work, including transferringpatients, helping the patient get to the right position, carrying cassettes with one hand, lifting the patient and positioning cassette underneath him or her at the same  
time, adjusting the X-ray tube and consoleoperation.It is recommended that medical radiologic technologists should have adequate recognition of the risks they are exposing themselves to.In addition, better manpower planning, improvement of standard operation procedures,and redesign of tools and workstations are needed to help reduce musculoskeletal disorders among medical radiologic technologists.

Ten mature-consumer-oriented brassieres available in the market were chosen for investigation. A questionnaire survey of 101 females and a series of expert assessment were conducted to help identify 20 pairwise phrases that describe the feelings delivered by the brassiere. Invite 12 female to join the research, whose ages are between 50 to 59, the educational level are above junior high school with the bra size are 80B, and has ever browsed the lingerie website. After that, it covers four stages of brassiere purchase, including previewing the product on the Internet and catalog, seeing the product in reality, seeing and touching the product in reality, and trying on the product. At the end of each of the four stages, the participant will rate her feeling toward the sample based on the 20 sets of pairwise phrases. Finally, an open interview will be performed to collect the overall feelings and additional comments. 
With the subjective ratings, principal component analysis were conducted to extract the two major adjectives that explain the variation among samples. Cluster analysis was further employed to determine the few categories of brassiere designed for mature females. Moreover, through the use of Quantification Theory Type I, the relationship between design parameters and subjective feelings were identified towards the better design. In phase 1 （part I: network vision） the embroidery lace can create feelings of ""beautiful and cool"". In phase 1 （part II: visual image） the general rims and embroidery lace can create feelings of ""beautiful and covered"". In phase 2 （real vision）general rims and front closure buckle can create feelings of ""beautiful and function"". In phase 3 （combining vision and tactile sense） the full cup and general rims can create feelings of ""cool and support"". In phase 4 （try-on） general rims and elastic lace can create feelings of ""beautiful and perspiration"".

Flight unloading zone assignment
Hybrid simulation-analytical approach","In recent years, the number of flights and baggage in Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport (TPE) increase year after year.  In consequence, the type of unloading area in baggage handling system is changed from unloading belt lateral to carousel.  Carousel has bigger capacity so that ground service can carry the baggage for more than two flights simultaneously.  Nonetheless, owing to the decrease in unloading area, the flights need to be rearranged.  If the flight is not arranged well, more than one flight may be arranged to the same carousel at the same time.  As a result, the carousel may malfunction because of too much baggage. Besides, it will make the ground service hard to differentiate the baggage of different flights so that the possibility of mishandling of baggage may increase.
In order to arrange all flights to carousel in an appropriate way, in this paper, under consideration to the impact of traveling time, we use “min overlap time” as the objective of unloading zone assignment problem.  For the sake of taking the influence of simulation model on traveling time into consideration, we propose to use a hybrid simulation-analytical approach to benefit from two models in order to get ideal and optimal solution in less computational effort.  Besides, we collect a lot of historical data and use data fitting to generate different input data to avoid subjective experimental result.
In addition to overlap time, baggage with manual operation can also reflect the possibility of mishandling of baggage.  And we know that the setting of carousel-opening time is the main influencing factor of baggage with manual operation. In the cause of improving the overall considerations so as to decrease possibility of mishandling of baggage, we can find better parameter setting of carousel-opening time and unloading zone assignment solution under comprehensive consideration of these two performances.
In this paper, we conduct experiments and perform analysis by hybrid simulation-analytical approach.  The experimental results show that it performs well by one iteration.  It can reduce 77 percent of overlap time on average compared to practical arrangements.  Besides, the experimental results also show that different unloading zones and time intervals have their own suitable methods of arrangement.  As a result, we can provide experimental results and suggestion to airport managers and BHS managers.  And managers can take as a reference step by step when making decision.

We also test the effectiveness of our developed assessment to ensure its practical use in the industrial field.
The study consists of 2 parts. The first part is the development of a new assessment and the second part is the evaluation of effectiveness of newly developed tracing task. In the second part we had 20 participants performing 3 tasks 3 times in a random order, and fulfill each task at 3 times, including newly developed tablet tracing task, Purdue Pegboard and phone assembly task. We took the performance of each tests and performed correlation test to see whether the tracing test result could reflect the performance on Purdue Pegboard and the phone assembly task.

Studies regarding carrying were mostly focused on backpack weight. There were few study investigated walking speed or baby carrier effects. The purpose of this study was to investigate the physiological and biomechanical responses in men and women while carrying the baby or backpack.
The first study compared gender differences using the baby sling and front worn harness carrier in the physiological and psychophysical responses. Ten females (aged 23-32 years) and ten males (aged 23-35 years) were recruited to participate in this study. Each subject was asked to carry two different weighted baby dummies (7kg and 10kg) using 3 different baby carriers and walk for 20 minutes. Body tactile pressures were measured. The physiological responses, which were recorded during walking included average surface electromyography (sEMG), skin temperature change, heart rate change and exercise intensity. Immediately after walking, the Borg’s rating scale of perceived exertion was used to collect the psychophysical responses. The traditional baby sling and the two front worn harness carrier showed little differences in sEMG activities, body tactile pressure and exercise intensity. Carrying two different weighted baby dummies caused significant differences in sEMG and body tactile pressure. Gender differences were found in sEMG activities, where men used more upper back muscles and women used more low back muscles. Based on the findings of this study, recommendations about the improved baby carrier design are proposed.
The second study examined the backpack load effect on gender walking gait and speed parameters. Twenty subjects (10 males, 10 females) with ages ranging from 21-28 years were involved in a backpack carrying task. The load was specified at 0%, 10%, 15% and 20% of their body weight. The three walking speed levels included preferred walking speed (PWS), 80% PWS and 120% PWS. The response measures included lower extremity joint motion, surface electromyography (sEMG) activities and ground reaction force (GRF) during walking. The results indicated that the load effect was a dominant factor. The increase in backpack weight produced a decrease in pelvis anterior tilt, hip extension and an increase in pelvis posterior tilt. The rectus abdominis muscle activity increased, but the erector spinae and semitendinosus activities decreased with increasing backpack weight. The vertical GRF component increased with the increase in backpack weight. Shoulder area perceived exertion discomfort was the highest at 20% BW load. Post hoc test results showed less difference between 10% BW and 15% BW, but greater differences between 20% BW and the lower weights. Gender differences were found in pelvic ROM, where women had smaller ROM in sagittal plane but larger ROM in frontal plane. In conclusion, people used different muscles with a change in gait pattern to accommodate a heavier backpack. The results from this study provide very useful recommendations for backpack weight and training recommendations for different gender.

In this study, we focus on the posture of squat, one of the postures been shown to be strongly associated with MSDs.　This research aims to develop a squat assistance tool and evaluate its influences at the lower limbs when participants wear the proposed squat assistance tool with different angles in performing a task using  squatting posture. Ten males and ten females participated in this study. Two independent variables were tested in this study, the angle of assistance tool (0°: assistance tool was not used, 7.5°, 15°)and the squatting posture (full squat and full squat with one knee close to the ground).  Each participant completed a total of 6(3x2) trials. In each trial, the participant moved along with at a constant pace (every 20 seconds) and fixed step length (30cm each step) for a total of 150 seconds. The electromyography (EMG) was used as a measure of activity level of the lower limbs.  The joint coordination data were collected by a motion tracking system to calculate the joint angles. By the end of trial, each participant was asked to fill out a questionnaire about his/her subjective feelings. The results showed that use of assistance tools during squatting can reduce the fatigue. When adopting the posture of full squat with one knee close to the ground, the use of the 7.5°assistance tool can significantly decrease about 12.45% of the %RVC value of right rectus femoris (RRF). While adopting the posture of full squat, the use of the 15°assistance tool can significantly decrease 19.23% of the %RVC value of right rectus femoris (RRF).

TRIZ (Teoriya Resheniya Izobreatatelskikh Zadatch )","Physical contradiction is at the heart of TRIZ contradiction problem solving. Physical contradiction is based on two contradictory demands placing on a same parameter of the same system. Extending from the concept of Separation Principles, System Transition, Parameter Deployment and Parameter Manipulation ,this research proposed a unified theory and concrete operational procedures based on Substance-Function-Attribute Modeling and graphed physical contradiction and Parameter Manipulation to solve physical contradictions. The method of Parameter Manipulation includes Parameter Domination, Parameter Separation and Parameter Transfer. The idea of Parameter Domination is to identify compatible constituent parameters and strength the parameters to reach the simultaneous satisfaction of two dissimilar objectives. The idea of Parameter Separation is to delegate the satisfaction of the two contradictory demands to their two constituent parameters or two value ranges of a constituent parameter at the problem areas thus the contradiction can be eliminated. The idea of Parameter Transfer is to transfer one or both satisfaction of the two contradictory demands to one or two parameter(s) seemingly unrelated to the problem point thus avoiding the contradiction.
The contributions of this research include: (1) Strengthening a unified theory of parameter manipulation with Parameter Domination, Parameter Separation and Parameter Transfer; (2) Graph original 17 problem solving strategies which were proposed in Parameter Deployment and Parameter Manipulation, and incorporate Parameter Domination to form 18 problem solving strategies to solve physical contradictions; (3) Applying graphical problem solving strategies to former cases and attaining more solutions than previous methods to increase the rate of problem solving, and adding new cases to verify the practicality of graphical problem solving strategies; (4) Strengthening standard procedures, forms, instructions and case examples to assist users to learn and use easily."

Coordinate System Calibration","Many automatic machines are used in modern factories to replace manual works. However, there are many high-loaded tasks sometimes still need to be performed manually. This could put the workers under high risks of musculoskeletal injuries. In order to indentify the potential injury when workers perform various jobs, their working postures need to be collected and analyzed. Tranditionally, a complex and expensive motion tracking are used to collect these movement data. Recently, many researchers proposed the use of low cost RGB-D camera as an alternative. But not many researchers evaluated the capability of RGB-D cameras objectively before using it. In this study, we evaluate the accuracy of the RGB-D camera when it was used to track several static postures. The data from traditional motion tracking system were compared to the data outputs from the RGB-D camera. A total of 12static standing poustures and 9 static sitting postures were evaluated. The effect of RGB-D camera viewing angles (0°、45°、90°) are also examined."

Response Surface Methodology","5-axis flank machining has received much attention in various industries since the late 90s. This advanced machining operation is particularly suitable in manufacturing complex components such as turbine blades, compressors, molds, and automobile as well as aerospace structure parts. With two rotational degrees of freedom in the cutter motion, 5-axis flank machining offers superior shaping capability and reduces part handling tasks compared to traditional 3-axis machining. However, tool path planning becomes complicated, as the cutter is likely to collide with objects in the machining environment. Past studies tried to use meta-heuristic methods to solve this problem, such as particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm, and ant colony optimization, but the search process is lack of efficiency and the solution quality is sometimes not acceptable. Thus, this research develops advanced tool path planning methods based on statistical techniques and completes the following tasks: “Electromagnetism-Like Algorithms for Optimized Tool Path Planning,” “Iterative Optimization of Tool Path Planning by Integrating Sampling Techniques,” “Multilevel Simplification of Solution Space in 5-Axis Flank Machining,” and “ Tool Path Planning based on Distribution of Tolerances.” Simulation results of representative test surfaces validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. This work provides a feasible approach to controlling machining errors, which enhances the practical values of 5-axis CNC machining technologies."

Many countries had proposed large scale project about AIMS, such as Manufacturing Renaissance of the USA, Industry 4.0 of the Germany, Industry 4.1J of the Japan, Made in China 2025. Executive Yuan of Taiwan proposed the similar project called Productivity 4.0 in 2015. This project focuses on the key technologies, such as sensing, intelligent robotic device, Internet of Things (IoT), and big data analysis.
    This dissertation aims to proposed a framework of AIMS for future smart factory. This framework consists with three parts, that is, open connected enterprise platform, smart manufacturing and smart product. Each part is connected with several research fields and topics, such as cloud computing, smart optimization method, big data analysis and sensor communication. Based on the AIMS framework, the industries can gradually improve their automation systems and processes in production line. Finally, the industries will upgrade to the smart factory in Industry 4.0.
    To validate the proposed smart optimization method, two empirical studies for semiconductor manufacturing and hepatitis in-vitro diagnostic device manufacturing are illustrated. The results show that the cycle time, the wafer scrap and product delivery tardiness can be reduced. Finally, the proposed smart optimization method can be embedded in the scheduling system of practical production line.

Moreover, with positive probability, a workstation successfully passes an input unit to the next node in the network. The “system reliability” is an important performance measure in stochastic systems. The application of stochastic systems are manufacturing system, network system and logistics system.
According to the latest literature [19], we have found that eighteen papers have actually incorrectly calculated the system reliability. Paper [19] presents a correct version of analytical approach, named Song Rule, limited to one production line with one rework system. Motivated by the problem that the Song rule is computational inefficient, this thesis proposes an extended Song rule to improve the efficiency of computation. Moreover, this thesis extends the Song rule to present a general analytical theory for networks with multiple reworks. The
proposed method is more computational efficient than the Song rule. Specifically, the proposed extended Song rule accomplishes an computation-time-reduction of above 90% for networks with more than 2 workstations. Moreover, all analytical results presented in this paper are validated via simulation approaches including C and Flexsim."

The production plan decision crosses the different department, such as sales, procurement, manufacturing, allocation, etc. The Decision Maker need to consider Multi-Attribute Decision Making. Moreover, due to the lack of homogeneity in the product, process variation affects the output distribution, solar cell will be graded and allocated based on different power efficiency, color, and other characteristics to meet customer’s various requirements. To meet customer orders, it often leads to excess inventory. Under the situation of short life cycle of solar cells, excessed stocks will increase company's costs and risks. Therefore, this study develops a two level TOPSIS Multi-Objective Fuzzy Goal Programming(TOPSIS-MOFGP). Based upon simultaneous shortest distance from positive ideal solution (PIS) and furthest distance from negative ideal solution (NIS). In the proposed approach can achieve compromise solution of the problem by maximizing the profit, demand fulfill, capacity utilization and minimizing inventory. In this study, we compare the results from real-world case study, and establish the different scenario to test the model validity to provide the suggestion to Decide Maker.
